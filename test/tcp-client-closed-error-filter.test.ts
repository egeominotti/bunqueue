/**
 * ClientClosedError sentinel subclass — verifies the dedicated class used by
 * TcpClient.close() to identify the synthetic rejection issued by rejectAll.
 *
 * Regression context: the original implementation matched `error.message ===
 * 'Client closed'` exactly, which would collide with third-party libraries
 * that throw the same string (Redis clients, DB pools). Skeptic flagged this
 * as a soundness issue; the fix introduces `ClientClosedError` so the filter
 * uses `instanceof` and is collision-free.
 *
 * We deliberately do NOT test process.on('unhandledRejection') event firing
 * here because Bun's test runner treats fire-and-forget rejections as test
 * failures, conflicting with the global event-loop semantics we'd be probing.
 * That interaction is covered in child processes by
 * repro-client-closed-filter-swallows-app-rejections.test.ts and by the TCP
 * integration suite (test-sandboxed-worker.ts), which exercises the full
 * close-and-rejectAll path against a live server and exits cleanly with code 0.
