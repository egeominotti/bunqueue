"""Batches completed-job ACKs into ACKB round-trips for higher throughput.

Opt-in (see the Worker ``ack_batch`` option; mirrors the TypeScript SDK's
AckBatcher). Items flush when the buffer reaches ``max_size`` or after
``max_delay_ms``, whichever comes first; :meth:`flush` drains the rest on
shutdown. Each item's ``on_settled`` fires after the batch is applied, ignored,
or errored, so the worker keeps a job "active", and its lock renewed, until
the server has returned authoritative positional evidence.
