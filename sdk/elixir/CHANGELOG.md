# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Negotiate wire protocol v3 and advertise the `separate-job-name`
  capability in `Hello`.
- Send ordinary job names through top-level `"name"`, preserve every user term
  in `"data"`, decode legacy data envelopes, and use `"jobName"` for scheduler
  jobs.
- Keep broker timeouts authoritative when a processor returns or fails late:
  `run_once/1` still reports the settled handler attempt, while an acknowledged
  `already-finalized` ACK/FAIL no-op no longer increments worker terminal
  counters. Reject unknown terminal response evidence as a protocol error and
  cover both real outcomes plus malformed evidence.
- Fix the sustained soak assertion to match the public `Queue.obliterate/1`
  return value, `:ok`.
- Replace multi-command flow creation and best-effort rollback with a pure
  tree/chain planner and one broker-atomic `PUSHF` commit.
- Preallocate secure colon-free IDs, forward explicit job IDs as `customId`,
  make parent/child links and internal markers reciprocal, and reject reserved
  data, topology overrides (including empty values), non-empty/invalid chain
  `children`, repeat, deduplication, and debounce before I/O.
- Validate the exact ID/queue bijection in returned snapshots and construct
  nodes from those authoritative snapshots.
- Add StreamData 1.4.0 tree/chain properties with shrinking, atomic tree and
  chain E2E tests, and separate Muex 0.8.1 mutation campaigns for the pure
  planner and snapshot validator.
- Fix the `deduplication` job option: it was sent as `dedup` without a
  `uniqueKey`, so the broker accepted and ignored it and same-id adds created
  separate jobs. Its `id` now becomes `uniqueKey` (an explicit non-empty
  `uniqueKey` still wins, in any option order) and only
  `ttl`/`extend`/`replace` travel as `dedup`, in `add`, `add_bulk`, and every
  other option path. A missing or empty `id`, unknown fields, a struct, or
  combining it with raw `dedup` raise `ArgumentError`; scheduler job templates
  reject it by name. Regression-tested against a real broker.

## 0.1.1

- Fix `Bunqueue.Job.log/2`: it sent the wire command `Log`, which the server
  rejects as unknown; it now sends `AddLog` like every other SDK, so job log
  lines are actually persisted. Regression-tested against a real broker.
  Known gap: unlike the other SDKs, `log/2` does not accept a `level` yet;
  the server records the line at the default `info` level.

## 0.1.0

- Add OTP-owned plain TCP and verified TLS connections with auth-first lazy
  reconnect, request correlation, command timeouts, and stream teardown.
- Add recursive JavaScript-safe integer encoding, ext-0 tolerance, and
  incoming/outgoing 64 MiB frame limits.
- Add queue producing, query, control, DLQ, scheduler, rate-limit, worker, job,
  and flow APIs.
- Add structured connection telemetry, ExUnit coverage, and the shared
  conformance driver.
- Keep request-sequence state available to connection error recovery and add
  the formatter configuration used by the isolated validation gate.
- Bound pulled leases by processing concurrency, make concurrent worker stops
  race-free, and exercise e2e, authentication, reconnect, and CA-verified TLS
  against disposable real brokers.
- Make worker stop idempotent, clamp client polling to 30 seconds, and map
  integers beyond the float64 range to a typed protocol error.
- Drain active handler executions through an OTP lifecycle barrier before
  unregistering or closing worker connections.
- Emit a payload-free structured `close` event when a connection terminates.
- Terminate the worker lifecycle process after draining while preserving
  race-safe, idempotent repeated stops.
- Include the MIT license in the Hex package contents.
- Ignore Mix build, dependency, documentation, coverage, and Hex archive
  outputs in the SDK worktree.
- Pin development/test dependencies and add concurrent idempotency and
  single-lease races, generated payloads, malformed-term fuzzing, a 512-job
  spike, durable SIGKILL recovery, and a tagged sustained profile.
