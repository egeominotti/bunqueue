---

The bunqueue server runs on Bun, distributed as a binary or a Docker image.
This client lets any Elixir service produce and consume jobs against it: one
queue, any language.

## Installation

Requires Elixir 1.15+ and OTP with `:ssl` and `:public_key`. The only runtime
serialization dependency is `msgpax`.

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    # Hex release upcoming; use a checkout as a path dependency today:
    {:bunqueue_client, path: "../bunqueue/sdk/elixir"}
  ]
end
```

## Quick start

Start a server (`bunx bunqueue start` or the Docker image), then:

```elixir
# Producer
queue = Bunqueue.queue("emails", host: "127.0.0.1", port: 6789)

{:ok, job} =
  Bunqueue.Queue.add(
    queue,
    "welcome",
    %{user_id: 42},
    attempts: 5,
    backoff: 1_000,
    jobId: "welcome-42"
  )

{:ok, fetched} = Bunqueue.Queue.get_job(queue, job.id)
{:ok, counts} = Bunqueue.Queue.get_job_counts(queue)
```

```elixir
# Worker (blocking; concurrency-bounded)
worker =
  Bunqueue.Worker.new(
    "emails",
    fn job ->
      Mailer.deliver(job.data)
      {:ok, %{delivered: true}}
    end,
    connection: [host: "127.0.0.1", port: 6789, token: System.fetch_env!("TOKEN")],
    concurrency: 16,
    batch_size: 64
  )

Bunqueue.Worker.run(worker)
```

Retries, backoff, priorities, delays, stall detection and the dead letter
queue all live in the server; the worker only pulls, heartbeats and
acknowledges.

## Producing jobs

Single-job `jobId` is automatically renamed to `customId` inside `PUSHB`.
Unknown options raise `ArgumentError`; advertised options are never silently
dropped.

`deduplication` collapses repeated adds of the same key into one job. Its `id`
is sent as the broker's `uniqueKey` and `ttl`/`extend`/`replace` as the nested
`dedup` policy, exactly like the other SDKs:

```elixir
# Same id within 1 hour = no new job; the second call returns the first job.
{:ok, first} =
  Bunqueue.Queue.add(queue, "notify", %{user_id: "123"},
    deduplication: %{id: "notify-123", ttl: 3_600_000}
  )
```

The value may be a map or keyword list. A missing, empty, or non-string `id`,
an unknown field, a struct, or combining it with the raw `dedup` option raises
`ArgumentError`; an explicit non-empty `uniqueKey` takes precedence over the
`id` in any option order. Integers outside int32 are recursively encoded as float64 for
JavaScript interoperability (exact up to 2^53; pass larger 64-bit identifiers
as strings).

Job names are top-level protocol metadata. `job.name` reads that field, while
`job.data` preserves the submitted term, including a map with its own name,
scalar, list, or `nil`. Legacy maps that stored the job name inside data remain
readable. Scheduler templates use separate `"jobName"` and `"data"` fields.
The client negotiates protocol v3 and advertises `separate-job-name` in `Hello`.

The queue module also exposes pause/resume/drain/clean, delayed-job promotion,
DLQ retry and purge, rate and concurrency limits, and cron schedulers.
Scheduler `limit` and `tz` map to the wire fields `maxLimit` and `timezone`.

## Worker semantics

- `batch_size` is clamped to `1..1000`, and each pull is additionally bounded
  by the worker concurrency so no lease waits outside the heartbeat lifecycle.
- The worker registers before every pull, so a lazily reconnected socket is
  registered before scheduler checks.
- Active leases are renewed through an independent connection. Polling is
  capped at 30 seconds. Set `heartbeat_interval: 0` to disable job heartbeats.
- `stop/1` is idempotent and safe while `run/1` is active: it rejects new
  runs, waits for every active handler and its ACK/FAIL, then unregisters,
  closes, and releases its lifecycle process.
- Raise `Bunqueue.UnrecoverableError` to skip remaining retries and
  dead-letter a job. ACK/FAIL failures are surfaced and never counted as
  completed processing.
- `run_once/1` reports how many handler attempts settled. If the broker has
  already finalized that exact lease generation (for example, by job timeout),
  its acknowledged `already-finalized` no-op still settles the attempt but does
  not advance either worker terminal counter or replace the broker outcome.
  Unknown terminal response data is surfaced as a protocol error.

## Security

TLS verifies the peer and hostname by default using the OTP system CA store:

```elixir
Bunqueue.queue("secure", host: "queue.example.com", port: 6789, tls: true)
Bunqueue.queue("private", host: "queue.internal", tls: true, ca_file: "/etc/bunqueue/ca.pem")
```

`verify: false` is an explicit development-only escape hatch. It is never
enabled implicitly. Authentication uses server-side tokens: pass
`token: "..."` in connection options.

## Structured telemetry

Pass `event_handler: fn event -> ... end` in connection options. The callback
runs in an isolated lightweight process and cannot break the connection.
Events are maps with `event`, `timestamp_ms`, and `generation`, plus
event-specific fields:

- `connected`: `host`, `port`, and `transport`
- `auth`: `ok` and, on failure, `error`
- `command`: `command`, `ok`, `req_id`, and `duration_us`
- `timeout` / `error`: `command`, `error`, and `duration_us`
- `reconnect`: emitted before `connected` for later socket generations
- `close`: emitted when the connection owner terminates

```elixir
handler = fn event -> Logger.info("bunqueue", bunqueue: event) end
queue = Bunqueue.queue("observed", event_handler: handler)
```

No token, job payload, result, or TLS secret is included in telemetry.

## Flows

`Bunqueue.FlowProducer` compiles the complete graph locally, then sends exactly
one `PUSHF` command. The broker either publishes every job with all links
resolved or publishes none. Returned nodes contain authoritative broker
snapshots.

```elixir
producer = Bunqueue.FlowProducer.new(host: "127.0.0.1", port: 6789)

{:ok, root} =
  Bunqueue.FlowProducer.add(producer, %{
    name: "send-summary",
    queue: "reports",
    data: %{account: "acme"},
    options: [jobId: "summary-acme"],
    children: [
      %{
        name: "build-report",
        queue: "reports",
        data: %{}
      }
    ]
  })

"summary-acme" = root.job.id
[%{job: child}] = root.children
true = is_binary(child.id)
Bunqueue.FlowProducer.close(producer)
```

Children run before their parent. A chain makes each step depend only on the
immediately preceding step:

```elixir
producer = Bunqueue.FlowProducer.new(host: "127.0.0.1", port: 6789)

{:ok, [extract_id, transform_id]} =
  Bunqueue.FlowProducer.add_chain(producer, [
    %{name: "extract", queue: "pipeline", data: %{}},
    %{name: "transform", queue: "pipeline", data: %{}}
  ])

true = extract_id != transform_id
Bunqueue.FlowProducer.close(producer)
```

The planner generates cryptographically secure, colon-free IDs unless `jobId`
is supplied. A custom ID is also sent as the server's `customId`, so custom-ID
lookup remains available. Duplicate, empty, colon-containing, and overlong IDs
are rejected before network I/O.

Planner errors never touch the connection, and broker rejection publishes
nothing. A timeout or malformed response after `PUSHF` is necessarily
ambiguous: the broker may already have committed, so the client returns an
error and does not attempt a partial rollback. Give production flows stable
explicit `jobId` values when callers may retry. The retry commits if the first
call did not; otherwise strict `PUSHF` collision checking returns
`already exists`. Treat that error as a reconciliation signal and query the
known IDs; the SDK does not fabricate the original snapshots.

Flow topology is owned by `FlowProducer`: `parentId`, `dependsOn`, and
`childrenIds` are rejected even when supplied as empty values. User data cannot
contain `name` or a key starting with `__`, because those fields carry
canonical topology markers. Atomic flows also reject repeat,
deduplication/unique-key, and debounce options. Chain steps may use
`children: []`, but non-empty or non-list `children` values are rejected. Trees
accept descendants through depth 100 from a depth-zero root, and one commit is
limited to 10,000 jobs.

## Quality assurance

Every change runs the ExUnit suite (disposable plain, authenticated, and TLS
brokers spawned per run) and the cross-language
[conformance suite](https://github.com/egeominotti/bunqueue/tree/main/sdk/conformance):

```bash
cd sdk/elixir
mix format --check-formatted
mix test
mix test test/flow_planner_property_test.exs test/flow_snapshots_test.exs
# Two Muex 0.8.1 campaigns: planner properties, then snapshot bijection.
mix mutants
# --timeout must exceed the soak: ExUnit kills a test at 60s by default.
BUNQUEUE_SDK_SOAK_SECONDS=3600 mix test --include soak --timeout 3900000 test/soak_test.exs

cd ../conformance
bun runner.ts --driver "cd ../elixir && mix run ../conformance/drivers/elixir.exs"
```

Hardening adds concurrent custom-id/single-lease races, generated payloads,
malformed-term fuzzing, shrinkable StreamData flow properties, exact snapshot
validation, atomic tree/chain E2E cases, a 512-job spike, and durable
SIGKILL/restart recovery. `mix mutants` invokes Muex 0.8.1 separately for
`lib/bunqueue/flow_planner.ex` and `lib/bunqueue/flow_snapshots.ex`, with only
their relevant pure tests. The tagged soak profile reuses one OTP connection;
`BUNQUEUE_SDK_SOAK_BATCH` controls stress.

Maintainers should read the [runtime invariants](INVARIANTS.md), the
[module and protocol guide](CLAUDE.md), and the
[local agent rules](AGENTS.md) before changing behavior.
