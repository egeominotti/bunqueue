# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Negotiate wire protocol v3 and advertise the `separate-job-name`
  capability in `Hello`.
- Send ordinary job names through top-level `name`, preserve every user `Value`
  in `data`, decode legacy data envelopes, and use `jobName` for scheduler jobs.
- Preserve UTF-8 strings exactly in `value_to_json` instead of rendering them
  with an extra pair of display quotes.
- Add real-broker worker regressions proving that late processor success and
  failure settle `run_once()` without overriding an authoritative broker
  timeout, result, or queue counters.
- Replace multi-command flow creation and best-effort rollback with a pure
  tree/chain planner and one broker-atomic `PUSHF` commit.
- Preallocate secure colon-free IDs, forward explicit job IDs as `customId`,
  make parent/child links and internal markers reciprocal, and reject reserved
  data, topology overrides, repeat, deduplication, and debounce before I/O.
- Validate the exact ID/queue bijection in returned snapshots and construct
  `FlowNode` values from those authoritative snapshots.
- Add `proptest` 1.7.0 tree/chain properties with shrinking, atomic tree and
  chain E2E tests, and cargo-mutants 26.0.0 campaigns scoped to the pure
  planner and snapshot validator.
- Correct the README API table to list only existing methods under their real
  names (no scheduler listing, webhooks, worker listing, stats, queue listing,
  progress query, or children values), complete the dependency list, and state
  that `Hello` is sent only by an explicit `Connection::hello()` call.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-07-20

- Documentation-only release: rewritten README with the standard header,
  absolute links (the 0.1.0 README used repository-relative links that broke
  on crates.io), crates.io install instructions, worker quick start, API
  surface table, and security/telemetry sections. No code changes.

## 0.1.0

- Initial Queue, Worker, FlowProducer, administration, TLS, auth, and protocol
  v2 implementation.
- Bound batch pulls by worker concurrency so no leased job waits without a
  heartbeat, and roll back earlier chain jobs when a later push fails.
- Reject non-string MessagePack map keys and outgoing extension values, and
  always join every processor thread before returning the first error.
- Add opt-in structured telemetry for connect/auth/commands/timeouts/reconnect,
  errors, close, and worker retry events. Callback panics are isolated and
  debug output redacts auth tokens.
- Add native coverage for frame limits, option/error/wire conversion, telemetry,
  auth, reconnect after timeout, verified TLS, worker registration, and flow
  rollback.
- Add concurrent idempotency and single-lease races, generated payloads,
  malformed extension fuzzing, a 512-job spike, durable SIGKILL recovery, and
  an ignored sustained profile.
- Certified by the shared 17-check bunqueue conformance suite.
