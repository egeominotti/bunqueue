# TypeScript SDK invariants

This file defines the contracts that must remain true for `bunqueue-client`.
The default entry shares the canonical `src/client` implementation. It is a
TCP client in Node.js, Deno, and Cloudflare Workers with `nodejs_compat`; Bun
can also load the actual canonical embedded engine. It is not an alternate
queue engine. The historical SDK implementation is isolated at `/legacy`.

## Canonical parity

- Public defaults, methods, constructors, options, return types, overloads,
  events, and nested public type references come from `src/client/index.ts`.
  Do not implement a second default Queue/Worker/FlowProducer/Bunqueue class.
- Runtime adapters may implement sockets, threads, files, clocks, environment,
  and random identifiers. They must not contain scheduling or job-state logic.
- `build` emits the canonical source graph, portable adapters, and declarations
  together. Its manifest hashes all source inputs and generated artifacts.
  Changed/missing sources, stale artifacts, or declaration differences fail
  the parity gate; no snapshot acceptance or broad exclusion list is allowed.
- The same native public behavior suites run against the compiled SDK. Random
  command histories additionally compare authoritative state/results/counters.
- Bun, Node 20/22, and Deno canonical scenarios are mandatory. Protocol
  conformance uses the default entry; compatibility tests use `/legacy`
  explicitly and never substitute for canonical parity coverage.
- The portable socket adapter reports a close only for a socket whose TCP
  connection opened, exactly like Bun's handlers. A refused attempt, or one
  abandoned before TCP opened, only rejects the connect; queued commands wait
  for the canonical reconnect and never fail with `Connection lost`.
- Published JavaScript has no top-level `await` and must re-bundle as
  CommonJS. The Bun-only engine loads synchronously on first embedded use and
  is never evaluated by Node, Deno, or Workers.
- Published declarations are self-contained: no `bun-types` reference, no Bun
  or DOM-only globals, no `bun:*` modules. The only runtime dependency is
  `msgpackr`; consumers bring their own `@types/node`.
- In TCP mode, top-level `host`, `port`, `token`, or `tls` options throw;
  connection settings live only in `connection`.
- The contracts below describe the retained low-level transport and historical
  compatibility API where it exposes additional SDK-specific helpers.

## Transport, framing, and authentication

- Every frame is one unsigned 32-bit big-endian payload length followed by one
  standard MessagePack map. The 64 MiB frame limit is enforced before a
  pending request, timer, or backpressure slot is retained.
- `FrameParser` must accept partial headers, partial payloads, and multiple
  frames per socket read without copying previously consumed bytes
  quadratically.
- Every command has one unique string `reqId`. A response settles only its
  matching pending call, exactly once; timeout, serialization failure,
  disconnect, and close remove its timer and pending entry.
- Pipelining may change response arrival order, never response ownership.
  Backpressure bounds in-flight calls without dropping or duplicating them.
- Reconnect is lazy. A timeout from an old connection generation must not tear
  down a newer socket.
- When configured, `Auth` is the first application command on a connection.
  Authentication failures remain typed and tokens never enter logs or
  telemetry. `Hello` negotiates `PROTOCOL_VERSION`.
- TLS verification is enabled by default. Custom CA files and an explicit
  verification opt-out preserve the same command framing.

## Serialization and option mapping

- `msgpackr` is used in standard MessagePack mode. Record extensions are
  forbidden because other SDKs cannot decode them.
- Wire values must be portable: reject `BigInt`, non-finite numbers, cycles,
  accessors, functions, symbols, non-string map keys, and custom object types
  before writing. Plain objects, arrays, dates, and binary values remain valid.
- `undefined` fields are omitted; meaningful `false`, `0`, empty strings, and
  explicit empty arrays are not removed accidentally.
- `PUSH` and `PUSHB` send the job name in top-level `name` and preserve `data`
  byte-for-byte at the value-model level, including a user-owned `data.name`,
  scalars, arrays, and null. Job readers prefer top-level `name` and unwrap
  only legacy envelopes that stored a string name inside `data`.
- Scheduler identity stays in `name`; the spawned job name uses `jobName`, and
  scheduler `data` remains user-owned.
- `wireJobOptions` is the single public-to-wire mapping:
  `attempts -> maxAttempts`, `jobId -> jobId` for ordinary `PUSH`, snake-free
  camelCase wire names for every other option. Adding an option requires a
  mapping assertion and a real-server test.
- Public administrative options supported by the broker must reach the wire;
  in particular `setGlobalRateLimit(max, duration)` sends `duration` while an
  omitted value stays omitted and retains the broker's one-second default.

## Queue and idempotency

- `Queue.add` returns the broker-assigned snapshot identity. A provided
  `jobId` is a custom idempotency key: concurrent retries from independent
  connections resolve to one logical job, not multiple queue entries.
- `addBulk` preserves request/result cardinality and ordering. A malformed
  response cannot be accepted as a successful partial batch.
- A queue name is immutable for a `Queue` instance. Commands cannot leak state
  or options from another queue.
- Producer retries may repeat a command after an uncertain transport outcome;
  custom-ID behavior must remain safe under that ambiguity.
- `close()` rejects or settles pending work predictably and closes only
  connections owned by the instance.

## Worker leases, heartbeat, ACK, and FAIL

- One job delivery has one lease token and at most one active processor in the
  client. ACK, FAIL, heartbeat, lock-extension, and Worker-owned discard
  commands use that exact token.
- Heartbeats continue while user work or an ACK batch is unsettled and stop on
  every terminal path. A heartbeat failure is observable; it cannot fabricate
  completion.
- A concurrency slot is acquired and released exactly once, including
  processor throws, serialization errors, connection errors, cancellation,
  and raising event listeners.
- `completed` and processed counters advance only after ACK succeeds. ACK or
  ACKB transport failure emits `error`, not a false completion.
- A successful transport response is not necessarily an applied transition.
  `{applied:false, reason:'already-finalized'}` suppresses the local terminal
  event and counter without emitting `error`. ACKB uses validated positional
  `ignoredIndices`; duplicate IDs must not be resolved from `ignoredIds` alone.
- Processor failure sends FAIL with the configured stack limit.
  `UnrecoverableError` sets `unrecoverable: true`; retryable failures do not.
- Graceful close stops pulling, keeps required heartbeats alive, flushes
  pending ACK batches, and waits for in-flight processors.

## FlowProducer atomic graph

- Tree, bulk-tree, chain, and fan-in planners are pure: no connection is used
  until the complete graph has validated and every ID has been allocated.
- `opts.jobId` is the planned job ID and becomes `input.customId`; `input.jobId`
  is never sent in `PUSHF`. Generated IDs use `randomUUID()` and are non-empty,
  unique within the batch, at most 1024 characters, and contain no `:`.
- One public creation call sends at most one `PUSHF`. Success creates the whole
  graph; rejection creates no jobs. Client-side `PUSH` + `UpdateParent` and
  best-effort rollback are forbidden.
- A transport timeout after sending `PUSHF` is an ambiguous outcome, not proof
  that no graph exists. A retryable production flow assigns a stable
  `opts.jobId` to every node. Retrying the same graph either commits it (when
  the first request did not) or returns the broker's `already exists`
  collision; the SDK must surface that collision for reconciliation and must
  not synthesize successful snapshots. Regenerated IDs cannot provide this
  guarantee.
- Every reference is closed within the batch. For each tree/fan-in edge:
  the parent lists the child in both `childrenIds` and `dependsOn`, the child
  has `parentId`, and data markers contain the same parent ID/queue and ordered
  child IDs. Dependency graphs are acyclic.
- Planner-owned data keys are immutable. User data named `name` or beginning
  with `__` is rejected. User `parentId`, `dependsOn`, and `childrenIds` are
  rejected instead of merged.
- `repeat`, `deduplication`, and `debounce` are rejected because they can
  change graph identity or cardinality. Flat chain/fan-in steps reject
  non-empty nested children and malformed non-array children; `children: []`
  is semantically empty.
- Queue defaults merge below per-job options. Supported scheduling, retention,
  failure-policy, logging, and size options must survive planning unchanged.
  `queuesOptions.*.jobId` is rejected before ID allocation because a queue
  default cannot define per-job identity.
- A successful response contains exactly one snapshot for every requested ID,
  with the expected queue and no duplicate or foreign ID. Public `FlowNode`
  objects are built from those snapshots, never synthetic placeholder jobs.

## Query and administration

- Response placement follows the broker handler, not intuition. Wrapped values
  such as logs, workers, children values, and webhooks are read from `data`;
  state, counts, pulled jobs/tokens, and push IDs remain top-level where the
  protocol defines them.
- Only a broker “not found” command error maps to `null`. Timeout, auth,
  connection, serialization, and other server errors remain observable.
- Filter, state, range, and pagination arguments are forwarded without local
  reordering. Returned arrays retain broker order.
- Destructive admin operations return the broker count/result and stay scoped
  to the instance queue unless the API is explicitly global.

## Executable evidence

Pure flow campaigns require no broker and use deterministic shrinking:

```bash
BUNQUEUE_FLOW_PBT_SEED=20260730 bun run test:property
# Replay a printed fast-check counterexample:
BUNQUEUE_FLOW_PBT_SEED=<signed-seed> \
  BUNQUEUE_FLOW_PBT_PATH='<printed-path>' bun run test:property
```

This SDK has no mutation engine. StrykerJS previously mutated the planners and
the snapshot validator, but its dependency graph was the only source of the
advisories the weekly audit reported, and none of those packages was reachable
from the published client. Carrying pinned overrides for a development-only
tool bought recurring audit noise and no user-visible safety, so the engine was
removed. The same surface stays covered by the fast-check campaigns above; the
other five SDKs still run mutation against their equivalents.

Public behavior requires real-server evidence and cross-runtime evidence:

```bash
bun run build && bun run check
bun tests/integration.ts
bun tests/e2e.ts
node --experimental-strip-types tests/e2e.ts
deno run -A tests/e2e.ts
bun run test:workers
```

The E2E harness must use a fresh broker, dynamic ports, and a temporary SQLite
directory. `/flows` in the Workers suite must exercise generated IDs so
`node:crypto.randomUUID` portability cannot regress unnoticed.
