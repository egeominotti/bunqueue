# bunqueue-client

**The official TypeScript client for [bunqueue](https://bunqueue.dev), the high performance job queue server.**

Native TCP protocol (msgpack, pipelined), the historical SDK compatibility API, one runtime dependency.
Runs everywhere: Node.js, Bun, Deno and Cloudflare Workers.

---

The bunqueue server runs on Bun, distributed as a binary or a Docker image. This client allows any Node.js, Bun, Deno, or Cloudflare Workers service to produce and consume jobs against it: one queue, any language, any runtime.

## Why bunqueue-client

- **Full API surface.** Queues, workers, flows (parent/children trees), schedulers, DLQ, rate limits, webhooks, Simple Mode: 110+ public methods, each covered by an e2e test against a real server.
- **Cross runtime by design.** Only `node:*` builtins, zero `Bun.*` globals, a single dependency (`msgpackr`). The same package runs on Node 20+, Bun, Deno 2 and Cloudflare Workers (`nodejs_compat`).
- **Production semantics.** Lock leasing with heartbeat renewal, at least once delivery with retries and backoff, unrecoverable failures straight to the DLQ, reconnection with half open detection, opt in ACK batching and connection pooling.
- **Typed end to end.** Generic `Queue<T>` / `Worker<T, R>`, typed worker events, structured telemetry hooks for your metrics stack.

## Compatibility

| Runtime | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js 20 or later | Supported, 116/116 e2e and 10/10 integration tests | ESM. TypeScript files run directly on Node 22 or later via `--experimental-strip-types` |
| Bun | Supported, 116/116 e2e and 10/10 integration tests | No additional configuration required |
| Deno 2 or later | Supported, 116/116 e2e and 10/10 integration tests | Uses `node:` builtins and the npm `msgpackr` package |
| tsx, ts-node, vitest, jest | Supported | These environments execute on Node.js |
| Cloudflare Workers | Supported, 16/16 e2e tests inside workerd, including Simple Mode and the full API surface | Requires the `nodejs_compat` compatibility flag. The runtime is request scoped, so long lived worker loops are not available: consume in batches from Cron Triggers or Durable Object alarms, a pattern covered by the test suite. TLS connections require a publicly trusted certificate |
| Browser | Not supported | Raw TCP sockets are unavailable. Use the server HTTP API instead |

Portability is guaranteed by design: the client relies exclusively on `node:*` builtins (`net`, `tls`, `events`, `crypto`, `os`), uses no `Bun.*` globals and no runtime specific imports, and carries a single runtime dependency, `msgpackr`.

## Installation

```bash
npm install bunqueue-client
# or: bun add bunqueue-client / pnpm add bunqueue-client / deno add npm:bunqueue-client
```

## Quick start, step by step

Every step from zero to a production ready queue.

### Step 1. Run the bunqueue server

The server is the only component that requires [Bun](https://bun.sh). Pick one:

```bash
# Option A: one command, no install (requires Bun)
bunx bunqueue start

# Option B: Docker, with persistent data
docker run -d --name bunqueue \
  -p 6789:6789 -p 6790:6790 \
  -v bunqueue-data:/app/data \
  ghcr.io/egeominotti/bunqueue:latest
```

Port 6789 is the TCP protocol (what this client uses), port 6790 is the HTTP API with `/health`, `/metrics`, and dashboard endpoints.

### Step 2. Install the client

```bash
npm install bunqueue-client
# or: bun add bunqueue-client / pnpm add bunqueue-client / deno add npm:bunqueue-client
```

### Step 3. Add your first job and process it

Create `app.ts`, one file for the sake of the demo:

```typescript
import { Queue, Worker } from 'bunqueue-client/legacy';

const worker = new Worker('hello', async (job) => {
  console.log('processing', job.data);
  return { greeted: job.data.name };
});
worker.on('completed', (job, result) => {
  console.log('completed', job.id, result);
  worker.close();
});

const queue = new Queue('hello');
await queue.add('greet', { name: 'world' });
queue.close();
```

Run it with the runtime you already use:

```bash
node --experimental-strip-types app.ts    # Node 22 or later
bun app.ts                                # Bun
deno run -A app.ts                        # Deno 2 or later
```

Expected output:

```
processing { name: 'world' }
completed 019f40a5-... { greeted: 'world' }
```

The operation name and user payload are independent: this job has
`job.name === 'greet'` while `job.data.name === 'world'`. Objects, arrays,
scalars, and null are sent as `data` without wrapping; readers still decode
jobs written by clients that used the legacy `data.name` envelope. Scheduler
templates follow the same rule through their distinct `jobName` field.
The client negotiates protocol v3 and advertises `separate-job-name` in `Hello`.

Defaults are `host: 'localhost'` and `port: 6789`, so constructors need no options on a local setup.

### Step 4. Split producer and worker

In production the producer and the worker are separate services, often in different languages. The producer is typically an API endpoint:

```typescript
// api-service: adds jobs, no processing
import { Queue } from 'bunqueue-client/legacy';
const queue = new Queue('emails', { host: 'queue.internal', port: 6789 });
await queue.add('welcome', { to: 'user@example.com' }, { attempts: 3 });
```

The worker is a long running process:

```typescript
// worker-service: processes jobs, no HTTP
import { Worker } from 'bunqueue-client/legacy';
new Worker('emails', sendEmail, { host: 'queue.internal', port: 6789, concurrency: 10 });
```

The [Python client](https://github.com/egeominotti/bunqueue/tree/main/sdk/python) speaks the same protocol against the same queue, so the worker can be a Python service instead.

### Step 5. Observe and operate

```typescript
await queue.getJobCounts();      // { waiting, active, completed, failed, delayed, ... }
await queue.getDlq();            // jobs that exhausted their retries
await queue.retryDlq();          // send them back to the queue
await queue.getWorkers();        // connected workers
await queue.getStats();          // throughput and totals
```

Or hit the HTTP side: `curl http://localhost:6790/health`.

### Step 6. Go to production

```typescript
const queue = new Queue('emails', {
  host: 'queue.example.com',
  port: 6789,
  token: process.env.BUNQUEUE_TOKEN,   // server started with AUTH_TOKENS=...
  tls: true,                            // or { caFile: './ca.pem' }
});
```

Checklist: set `AUTH_TOKENS` on the server, enable TLS (`TLS_CERT_FILE`/`TLS_KEY_FILE`), mount a volume for the SQLite data path, monitor `/health` and `/metrics`, and size worker `concurrency` to your workload. Full guide: [bunqueue.dev/guide/deployment](https://bunqueue.dev/guide/deployment/).

## Producing jobs

```typescript
import { Queue } from 'bunqueue-client/legacy';

const queue = new Queue('emails', { host: 'localhost', port: 6789 });

await queue.add('send', { to: 'user@example.com' }, { priority: 5, attempts: 3 });
await queue.addBulk([
  { name: 'send', data: { to: 'a@b.c' } },
  { name: 'send', data: { to: 'x@y.z' }, opts: { delay: 5000 } },
]);

const counts = await queue.getJobCounts();
queue.close();
```

## Processing jobs

```typescript
import { Worker, UnrecoverableError } from 'bunqueue-client/legacy';

const worker = new Worker(
  'emails',
  async (job) => {
    await job.updateProgress(50);
    if (job.data.invalid) throw new UnrecoverableError('bad payload'); // no retries, straight to the DLQ
    return { sent: true };
  },
  { host: 'localhost', port: 6789, concurrency: 10 }
);

worker.on('completed', (job, result) => console.log(job.id, result));
worker.on('failed', (job, err) => console.error(job.id, err.message));

// later: await worker.close();  // graceful shutdown, waits for in flight jobs
```

Retry, backoff, dead letter queue, stall detection, priorities, and rate limiting all execute server side. The worker only pulls, heartbeats, and acknowledges, which keeps the client thin and the behavior consistent across languages.

## Flows

```typescript
import { FlowProducer } from 'bunqueue-client/legacy';

const flow = new FlowProducer({ host: 'localhost', port: 6789 });

// sequential chain: step1, then step2, then step3
await flow.addChain([
  { name: 'step1', queueName: 'pipeline' },
  { name: 'step2', queueName: 'pipeline' },
  { name: 'step3', queueName: 'pipeline' },
]);

// fan in: parallel jobs converge into a final job that reads their results
const { finalId } = await flow.addBulkThen(
  [
    { name: 'part1', queueName: 'pipeline' },
    { name: 'part2', queueName: 'pipeline' },
  ],
  { name: 'merge', queueName: 'pipeline' }
);
// inside the 'merge' processor: await job.getChildrenValues()

// parent and child tree: children always run before the parent
const node = await flow.add({
  name: 'assemble',
  queueName: 'orders',
  opts: { jobId: 'order-42-assembly' },
  children: [
    {
      name: 'reserve-stock',
      queueName: 'orders',
      opts: { jobId: 'order-42-stock' },
    },
    { name: 'charge-card', queueName: 'orders' },
  ],
}, {
  queuesOptions: { orders: { attempts: 3, backoff: 500 } },
});

console.log(node.job.id);              // order-42-assembly
console.log(node.children?.[0].job.id); // order-42-stock
flow.close();
```

`add`, `addBulk`, `addChain`, and `addBulkThen` compile the complete dependency
graph locally, preallocate every ID, and send exactly one `PUSHF` command. The
broker either persists and publishes the entire graph or creates no jobs. The
returned `Job` objects are built from the broker's committed snapshots, so
state, options, and reciprocal parent/child links are immediately available.

`opts.jobId` becomes both the planned ID and the wire `customId`; generated IDs
are portable UUIDs and never contain `:`. Atomic flows reject `repeat`,
`deduplication`, and `debounce`, because those options can change graph
cardinality or identity. `parentId`, `dependsOn`, and `childrenIds` are owned
by the planner. Job data keys named `name` or beginning with `__` are reserved
for immutable flow metadata and are rejected instead of being overwritten.
`queuesOptions` may define scheduling and retention defaults, but not
`jobId`; identity is always chosen on the individual node.

A transport timeout after `PUSHF` is ambiguous: the broker may have committed
the complete graph before the response was lost. Assign a deterministic
`opts.jobId` to every node and reuse the same graph on retry. If the first call
did not commit, the retry can create it; if it did, strict `PUSHF` collision
checking returns `already exists` instead of rewriting the graph or fabricating
snapshots. Treat that error as a reconciliation signal and query the known
stable IDs. Regenerated IDs can create a second graph after an uncertain
outcome.

## Simple Mode

`Bunqueue` bundles a Queue and a Worker in one object, with routes, onion middleware, in process retry strategies, a circuit breaker, batch accumulation, event triggers, job TTL, priority aging, cooperative cancellation, and dedup or debounce defaults. It is a 1:1 port of the official client's Simple Mode, TCP only (the `embedded` option raises).

```typescript
import { Bunqueue, type Job } from 'bunqueue-client/legacy';

const app = new Bunqueue('notifications', {
  connection: { host: 'localhost', port: 6789 },
  concurrency: 10,
  routes: {
    'send-email': async (job: Job<{ to: string }>) => ({ channel: 'email' }),
    'send-sms': async (job: Job<{ to: string }>) => ({ channel: 'sms' }),
  },
  retry: { maxAttempts: 5, delay: 1000, strategy: 'jitter' },
  circuitBreaker: { threshold: 5, resetTimeout: 30_000 },
  ttl: { perName: { 'verify-otp': 60_000 } },
  deduplication: { ttl: 5000 },
});

app.use(async (job, next) => {
  const start = Date.now();
  const result = await next();
  console.log(`${job.name}: ${Date.now() - start}ms`);
  return result;
});

app.trigger({
  on: 'send-email',
  create: 'send-sms',
  data: (result, job) => job.data,
  condition: (result) => (result as { channel: string }).channel === 'email',
});

await app.cron('daily-digest', '0 9 * * *', { to: 'all' });
await app.add('send-email', { to: 'alice@example.com' });
// later: await app.close();
```

Use `processor` for a single handler, `routes` to dispatch by job name, or `batch` to accumulate N jobs into one call. Exactly one of the three is required.

## Scheduling

```typescript
await queue.addCron('daily-report', '0 9 * * *', { type: 'report' });
await queue.every('health-ping', 30_000, { type: 'ping' });
await queue.removeJobScheduler('daily-report');
```

## Security

```typescript
const queue = new Queue('emails', {
  host: 'queue.example.com',
  port: 6789,
  token: process.env.BUNQUEUE_TOKEN,
  tls: { caFile: './ca.pem' }, // or `true` for system certificate authorities
});
```

Authentication uses server side tokens (`AUTH_TOKENS`). Transport security uses native TLS, with support for system certificate authorities, a custom CA bundle, or disabled verification for development environments.

## Observability

Inject a logger and a telemetry sink to bridge the client into your stack. There are no hard dependencies — you wire OpenTelemetry, Prometheus or your own logger. Defaults are silent.

```typescript
import { Queue, consoleLogger, type TelemetryEvent } from 'bunqueue-client/legacy';

const queue = new Queue('emails', {
  logger: consoleLogger('info'), // or your own { debug, info, warn, error }
  onTelemetry: (e: TelemetryEvent) => {
    // command latency, lifecycle, auth, backpressure and sanitized errors
    if (e.type === 'command') metrics.observe(e.cmd, e.durationMs, e.ok);
    if (e.type === 'error') metrics.increment(`bunqueue.${e.operation}.errors`);
  },
});

// Connection is an EventEmitter for lifecycle hooks:
queue.connection.on('reconnect_scheduled', (i) => log.warn('reconnecting', i));
queue.connection.on('disconnect', () => log.warn('link down'));
```

`error` telemetry covers connect, socket, write, and serialization failures.
Its `message`, `errorType`, and optional system `code` are safe metadata: raw
error messages, authentication tokens, commands, and payloads are never sent to
the telemetry callback. Telemetry and logger callback failures are isolated
from transport operations.

## Throughput and resilience

```typescript
// Bound in-flight commands (backpressure) — parks callers instead of growing memory:
const queue = new Queue('emails', { maxInFlight: 10_000 });

// Fan producer commands across N connections (round-robin, producer-side):
const pooled = new Queue('emails', { poolSize: 4 });

// Batch worker ACKs into ACKB round-trips (opt-in) for high-volume consumers:
const worker = new Worker('emails', process, {
  ackBatch: { enabled: true, maxSize: 50, maxDelayMs: 5 },
});
```

Worker terminal events are broker-authoritative. If a timeout or retired cron
generation finalizes a lease while the processor is still returning, the
broker accepts the late `ACK` or `FAIL` as an ignored outcome and the Worker
emits neither `completed` nor `failed`. Batched ACKs apply that decision by
input position, including batches that contain the same job ID more than once.
Worker-owned `job.discard()` sends the same delivery token as ACK/FAIL, so an
older processor cannot discard a newer active generation.

Always attach a `worker.on('error', …)` listener: per Node `EventEmitter` semantics an unhandled `error` event throws. The worker frees each job's concurrency slot before emitting, so even a throwing listener cannot degrade throughput — but the error itself is yours to observe.

Half-open links are detected via TCP keepalive and a consecutive-timeout teardown, so a silently dropped connection (cloud LB/NAT idle drop) recovers in seconds rather than minutes.

### Option validation

Constructors check durations and counts before anything connects or starts. A value that would become a hot loop, a hang, a timer that fires after about 1 ms instead of a long delay, or a timeout that fails every command throws a `TypeError` (not a number) or a `RangeError` (out of range) that names the option. A duration longer than the runtime's timer limit (about 24.8 days) is honoured; it does not fire after 1 ms.

Every value that worked in 0.2.2 keeps 0.2.2's result:

- A numeric string such as `'5000'` is read as its number, as 0.2.2's arithmetic and timers read it. A string that is not a number throws a `TypeError`, unless 0.2.2 ignored it (see `heartbeatIntervalS` and `batchSize` below).
- A one-shot delay (`ackBatch.maxDelayMs`, Simple Mode `retry.delay`, `circuitBreaker.resetTimeout`, `batch.timeout`, the `cancel()` grace period, a `retry.customBackoff` result) that is `NaN` or negative runs at once, as `setTimeout` ran it.
- Counts that 0.2.2 only compared are used as given, for example a `retry.maxAttempts` of 0 is one attempt.
- `undefined` keeps the default. `null` keeps the default, except where 0.2.2 read it as 0: `waitForJob(id, null)` is a zero hold and Simple Mode `heartbeatInterval: null` disables heartbeats.

Four options follow the clamps every official SDK applies (rule 4 of `sdk/CLAUDE.md` and `docs/protocol.md` in the bunqueue repository). A number never throws for these: an out-of-range value is clamped, and a non-finite value takes the default or disables the feature.

| Option | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Worker `heartbeatIntervalS` | `0`, negative, `NaN`, `±Infinity` or a non-number disables heartbeats; any positive period is honoured |
| Worker `batchSize` | clamped to [1, 1000]; `NaN`, `±Infinity` or a non-number means the default, 10 |
| Worker `pollTimeoutMs` | clamped to [0, 30000]; `NaN` means the default, 5000. After an empty pull the worker pauses 50 ms with `0`, 10 ms after a long poll |
| `waitForJob()` ttl | clamped to [0, 600000] ms; `NaN` (or omitted) means 30000, `null` means 0 |

The other options:

| Option | Accepted | Throws |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `connectTimeoutMs` | finite, >= 1 ms | `NaN`, 0, negative, `Infinity` |
| `commandTimeoutMs`, `call()` `timeoutMs` | >= 1 ms, or `Infinity` for no client-side deadline | `NaN`, 0, negative |
| `maxInFlight` | any number; 0, negative or `-Infinity` = unbounded | `NaN` |
| `ConnectionPool` size | floored; below 1 = one connection | `NaN`, `undefined`, `Infinity`, above 65535 |
| Queue `poolSize` | a truthy value above 1 builds a pool of the floored size; anything else is one connection | `Infinity`, above 65535 |
| Worker `concurrency` | whole number >= 1 | below 1 (`concurrency must be >= 1`, as in 0.2.2), `NaN`, a fraction, `Infinity` |
| Worker `lockTtlMs` | finite, >= 1 ms | `NaN`, below 1, `Infinity` |
| `ackBatch.maxSize` | any value; 0 or below sends every ACK at once | never |
| `ackBatch.maxDelayMs` | finite; `NaN` or negative flushes at once | `Infinity` |

A Queue given its own `connection` reads no connection option, as in 0.2.2, so none is checked.

Simple Mode (`Bunqueue`):

| Option | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `retry.maxAttempts` | compared as given: 0 or below is one attempt, 2.5 is three, `NaN` or `Infinity` retries until success, `cancel()` or `close()` |
| `retry.strategy` | an unknown strategy is a fixed delay |
| `retry.customBackoff`, `retry.retryIf` | not checked; one that is not a function fails the job when it is called |
| `retry.customBackoff` result | `NaN`, negative, `undefined` or `null` retries at once; `Infinity` or a non-numeric value fails the job with the processor error as `cause` |
| `circuitBreaker.threshold` | compared as given: 0 opens on the first failure, `NaN` never opens |
| `circuitBreaker.resetTimeout` | `Infinity` stays open until `resetCircuit()` |
| `batch.size` | compared as given: 0 flushes every job, omitted or `NaN` flushes on `timeout` (or close) only |
| `priorityAging.interval` | finite, >= 1 ms (a smaller one spins) |
| `priorityAging.minAge`, `maxPriority` | used as given |
| `priorityAging.boost` | any number, 0 changes no priority; a string throws (0.2.2 appended it to the priority) |
| `priorityAging.maxScan` | used as given; `Infinity` throws (0.2.2's tick crashed on it) |
| `rateLimit` / `limiter` `max` | a number > 0, fractions and `Infinity` included; 0, negative, `NaN` or omitted throws (0.2.2 waited forever) |
| `rateLimit` / `limiter` `duration` | 0, negative, `NaN` or omitted means no limit; `Infinity` throws (the window never frees) |
| `heartbeatInterval`, `pollTimeout` | forwarded to the Worker as `heartbeatInterval / 1000` and `pollTimeout`, under the clamps above |

The retry configuration is read at each job, as in 0.2.2, so changing the object passed as `retry` affects later jobs.

#### Differences from the default entry

The default entry (`bunqueue-client`) follows `bunqueue/client`: it keeps every result its comparisons gave a usable value and throws only for values that cannot run. The legacy entry keeps the SDK contract instead:

| Option | Default entry | Legacy entry |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Heartbeat interval | `0`, negative or `NaN` disables heartbeats; a positive value below 1 ms or `Infinity` throws a `RangeError` | disables heartbeats (a non-number too) |
| `batchSize` | a number > 0 (a fraction rounds up) or `Infinity`, clamped to 1000; `0`, negative or `NaN` throws a `RangeError` | any number, clamped to [1, 1000]; `0` or below means 1, a fraction is kept, non-finite or a non-number means 10 |
| Poll timeout | negative or `NaN` means 0 (no long poll); above 30000, `Infinity` included, clamps to 30000 | negative clamps to 0; `NaN` means 5000 |
| Wait TTL | `waitUntilFinished` treats a non-positive, `NaN` or infinite TTL as no timeout and can wait past 600000 ms | one `WaitJob` hold clamped to [0, 600000] ms; `NaN` means 30000, `null` means 0 |

Malformed or oversized commands reject with `SerializationError` before they
occupy an in-flight slot or write to the socket. This keeps bounded connections
usable after a local MessagePack encoding failure. Payloads may contain plain
objects, arrays, string-keyed maps, valid dates, and binary values; `BigInt`,
cycles, non-string map keys, symbols, functions, accessors, non-finite numbers,
and custom object types are rejected as non-portable.

## Typed responses

`connection.call<R>()` and `queue.call<R>()` are generic over the exported response shapes (`JobResponse`, `PulledJobsResponse`, `JobCountsResponse`, `WaitJobResponse`, …), so raw command access is fully typed without casting.

## API surface

| Area | Capabilities |
|---|---|
| Queue | `add`, `addBulk`, full `JobOptions`: priority, delay, attempts, backoff, ttl, timeout, jobId, deduplication, dependsOn, tags, groupId, lifo, removeOnComplete, removeOnFail, durable, repeat, debounce |
| Query | `getJob`, `getJobByCustomId`, `getJobs` with per state helpers, state, result, progress, `waitForJob` (throws on timeout, BullMQ contract), counts, counts per priority, children values, job logs |
| Control | pause, resume, drain, obliterate, clean, remove, discard, promote, `retryJob`, `retryJobs`, move to wait or delayed, change priority or delay, update data, extend lock |
| Dead letter queue | `getDlq`, `retryDlq`, `purgeDlq`, DLQ configuration |
| Administration | rate limiting with custom windows (`setGlobalRateLimit(max, duration)`), global concurrency, stall configuration, webhooks, stats, metrics, `listQueues`, `getWorkers` |
| Worker events | `ready`, `active`, `completed`, `failed`, `progress`, `drained`, `error`, `closed`, with automatic lock heartbeats so that jobs longer than the lock TTL survive |
| Simple Mode | `Bunqueue`: routes, middleware, in process retry (fixed, exponential, jitter, fibonacci, custom), circuit breaker, batch accumulation, triggers, TTL, priority aging, cancellation via `getSignal`, dedup and debounce defaults, cron shorthands |

The following features require the in process Bun runtime and are intentionally out of scope for this client: embedded mode, sandboxed workers, and `QueueEvents`. Use webhooks or the HTTP SSE and WebSocket endpoints for event streaming.

Note on numeric payloads: JavaScript numbers are IEEE 754 doubles, exact up to 2^53. Pass larger 64 bit identifiers, for example snowflake IDs, as strings to avoid silent precision loss. Never place `BigInt` values in job data.

## Quality assurance

Every release is validated against a real bunqueue server, spawned fresh for each run, across every supported runtime:

```bash
bun install
bun run build          # tsc, emits dist/
bun run check          # Oxlint and Oxfmt verification
BUNQUEUE_FLOW_PBT_SEED=20260730 bun run test:property

bun tests/integration.ts                            # smoke suite
bun tests/e2e.ts                                    # full surface, edge cases, realistic load
node --experimental-strip-types tests/e2e.ts        # identical suite on Node 22 or later
deno run -A tests/e2e.ts                            # identical suite on Deno 2 or later
bun run test:workers                                # full suite inside workerd, the Cloudflare Workers runtime
BUNQUEUE_SDK_SOAK_SECONDS=3600 bun run test:soak    # opt-in sustained connection profile
```

The e2e suite includes payload limits, unicode integrity, pipelining under
concurrency, 24-way idempotent retries, 12-way single-lease contention,
fixed-seed generated payloads, malformed mutation fuzzing, a 1500-job spike,
server crash/restart, and realistic zero-loss accounting. `test:soak` reuses
one pooled client; tune `BUNQUEUE_SDK_SOAK_BATCH` for stress diagnostics.
Engineering standards: Oxlint and Oxfmt, a maximum of 250 lines per file, and
relative imports with explicit `.js` extensions for NodeNext resolution.
Maintainers should read the [runtime invariants](INVARIANTS.md), the
[module and protocol guide](CLAUDE.md), and the
[local agent rules](AGENTS.md) before changing behavior.
