/**
 * A round-robin pool of TCP connections for producer-side throughput.
 *
 * Each `call()` is dispatched to the next connection, so independent commands
 * (PUSH, queries, control) fan out across N sockets instead of head-of-lining
 * on one. Use it for {@link Queue} / {@link FlowProducer}; NOT for a Worker,
 * whose pull→ack flow is bound to a single connection's lock ownership and
 * reconnect/registration lifecycle.
 *
 * Satisfies {@link ConnectionLike}, so it is a drop-in for a single Connection.
 * Lifecycle events from every member connection are re-emitted here.
