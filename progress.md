# Progress

Shared restart notes for every session and worktree. Work items, statuses and
evidence live in [`feature_list.json`](feature_list.json); this file holds what
the next session needs to resume. Edit rules for parallel worktrees: change only
your item's lines in Current State and prepend your Session Log entry. On a
rebase conflict, `**Last Updated:**` takes the newest date and the Session Log
keeps both entries, newest first. Nothing here authorizes a commit, push, version
bump, release or publication; only the user's explicit request does. Harness
overview: [docs/agents/README.md](docs/agents/README.md).

## Current State

**Last Updated:** 2026-11-12
**Active items:** many sessions run at once; the items in progress are the
`in-progress` entries of `feature_list.json`, each with its owning `branch`.

### What's Done

- `issue-189-tls-reload`: `SIGHUP` reloads the TLS certificate without a restart;
  commit `da289219` on `main`, sandbox green, skeptic `PASS`.
- `agent-harness`: `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` routing pages, `docs/agents/`, the state
  files, `./init.sh`, the contract tests `test/agent-harness-*.test.ts`, and the
  harness files in the sandbox test image; sandbox green on the final tree.

### What's In Progress

- Nothing recorded here; see the `in-progress` entries of `feature_list.json`.

### What's Next

1. `release-2.9.22` (not started, and only on the user's explicit request): the
   checklist in its `feature_list.json` description and
   [docs/agents/release.md](docs/agents/release.md).
2. `issue-189-unix-socket-followups`: reproducing tests first for the two
   unix-socket rollback notes in `src/infrastructure/server/httpListener.ts`, then
   the fix.
3. `agent-harness-followups`: the non-blocking notes of the harness review.

## Blockers / Risks

- `main` requires pull requests; only an account with bypass rights can push to it
  directly. The release push (CI's version gate tags, releases and publishes from
  `main`) therefore needs an account with write access to `main`, or a pull
  request merged by one.
- The release gates are long: `bun run test:sandbox` took 9.12 min of wall time on
  the last green run, and the SDK sandbox and both OrbStack Machines come on top.

## Decisions Made

- **No `STOPSIGNAL` in the Dockerfile** (issue 189): the images keep declaring no
  stop signal, for release compatibility. Consequence, documented in the TLS guide
  and the changelog: `docker kill -s HUP` counts as a manual stop for the restart
  policy; reload with `docker exec <container> kill -HUP 1` (or `sh -c` on debian
  and slim) or opt in with `--stop-signal SIGTERM` / Compose `stop_signal: SIGTERM`.
- **`SIGHUP` handler only with TLS configured**: without TLS the server installs no
  handler, exactly as in 2.9.21.

## Session Log

Newest first. Prepend one entry per session; for multi-session work fill the
[`session-handoff.md`](session-handoff.md) sections into the entry.

### 2026-11-12 — agent-harness

- Built the five-subsystem harness: `CLAUDE.md` (39,046 bytes before) and
  `AGENTS.md` (17,534 bytes before) became routing pages under 12 KiB that keep
  every mandatory rule; the reference sections moved verbatim to `docs/agents/`
  and the test rules to `docs/testing.md#agent-test-rules`; added
  `feature_list.json`, `progress.md`, `session-handoff.md`, `init.sh` and
  `docs/agents/README.md`.
- First skeptic review: `FAIL` (the unit container lacked the harness files, EOF
  blank lines, overclaimed status, a 315-line test file, loose contract checks).
  All fixed in the same uncommitted change; see the evidence below.
- Evidence after the fixes (host only, diagnostic; staged-plus-working tree):
  `bun test test/agent-harness` 22 pass / 0 fail (2 files); `./init.sh` green in
  about 5 s; `bun test test/docs-*.test.ts` 122 / 0;
  `bun test test/sdk-mutation-workflow.test.ts` 1 / 0; `bun run typecheck` and
  `bun run format:check` clean; `git diff --check` and `git diff --cached --check`
  clean; `generate-release-posts.ts --check` OK; course validator 100/100 (32
  before). A simulated test-image layout (`Dockerfile.test` COPY lines over the
  allow-listed context) runs the contract 22 / 0; the pre-fix layout reproduced
  the `ENOENT` failure.
- Second skeptic review: `CONDITIONAL` on the sandbox only. `bun run test:sandbox`
  on the exact staged tree: unit 11668 pass / 0 fail / 398 skip, tcp 553 / 0,
  embedded 349 / 0, no resource anomalies
  (`artifacts/test-sandbox/2026-11-12T20-20-16.500Z/`). `bun run test:model` and
  `bun run test:sandbox:sdk` not triggered (no `src/` or `sdk/` change). The
  remaining minor notes are the `agent-harness-followups` item.
