# Progress

Shared restart notes for every session and worktree. Work items, statuses and
evidence live in [`feature_list.json`](feature_list.json); this file holds what
the next session needs to resume. Edit rules for parallel worktrees: change only
your item's lines in Current State and prepend your Session Log entry. On a
rebase conflict, `**Last Updated:**` takes the newest date and the Session Log
keeps both entries, newest first. Nothing here authorizes a commit, push, version
bump, release or publication; only the user's explicit request does. Harness
overview: [docs/agents/README.md](docs/agents/README.md).

## Current State

**Last Updated:** 2026-11-12
**Active items:** many sessions run at once; the items in progress are the
`in-progress` entries of `feature_list.json`, each with its owning `branch`.

### What's Done

- `issue-189-tls-reload`: `SIGHUP` reloads the TLS certificate without a restart;
  commit `da289219` on `main`, sandbox green, skeptic `PASS`.
- `agent-harness`: `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` routing pages, `docs/agents/`, the state
  files, `./init.sh`, the contract tests `test/agent-harness-*.test.ts`, and the
  harness files in the sandbox test image; sandbox green on the final tree.

### What's In Progress

- Nothing recorded here; see the `in-progress` entries of `feature_list.json`.

### What's Next

1. `release-2.9.22` (in progress at the user's explicit request): steps 1-5 of
   [docs/agents/release.md](docs/agents/release.md) done and gated; after the push,
   watch CI's version gate (tag, GitHub release, npm, Docker), then step 7
   (`generate-release-posts.ts --refresh`, the post's install box and
   contributors). See its `feature_list.json` evidence and the Session Log.
2. `issue-189-unix-socket-followups`: reproducing tests first for the two
   unix-socket rollback notes in `src/infrastructure/server/httpListener.ts`, then
   the fix.
3. `agent-harness-followups`: the non-blocking notes of the harness review.
4. `ci-script-tests-bun-only-machines`: the two CI-script test files that need
   `node` in the Bun-only OrbStack Machines.

## Blockers / Risks

- `main` requires pull requests; only an account with bypass rights can push to it
  directly. The release push (CI's version gate tags, releases and publishes from
  `main`) therefore needs an account with write access to `main`, or a pull
  request merged by one.
- The release gates are long: `bun run test:sandbox` took 9.12 min of wall time on
  the last green run, and the SDK sandbox and both OrbStack Machines come on top.

## Decisions Made

- **No `STOPSIGNAL` in the Dockerfile** (issue 189): the images keep declaring no
  stop signal, for release compatibility. Consequence, documented in the TLS guide
  and the changelog: `docker kill -s HUP` counts as a manual stop for the restart
  policy; reload with `docker exec <container> kill -HUP 1` (or `sh -c` on debian
  and slim) or opt in with `--stop-signal SIGTERM` / Compose `stop_signal: SIGTERM`.
- **`SIGHUP` handler only with TLS configured**: without TLS the server installs no
  handler, exactly as in 2.9.21.

## Session Log

Newest first. Prepend one entry per session; for multi-session work fill the
[`session-handoff.md`](session-handoff.md) sections into the entry.

### 2026-11-12 — release-2.9.22 (preparation)

- Objective: checklist steps 1-4 of [docs/agents/release.md](docs/agents/release.md),
  at the user's explicit request; status `in-progress`, branch
  `tls-a-renewed-certificate-is-only-served-after-a`, base `18bfc76f`, nothing
  committed.
- Done: `package.json` 2.9.22; `bun run docs:api` (64 files of
  `docs/public/reference/v2.9`); the changelog section dated
  `## [2.9.22] - 2026-11-12`; the 15 Docker image references in `README.md` and
  the deployment, env-vars, installation and server guides, as `2d617fd3` did;
  the hand-written `docs/src/content/docs/blog/bunqueue-v2-9-22.md` (generated
  marker removed). No `sdk/` file changed.
- Decision: TypeDoc 0.28.20 only treats a `.git` directory as a repository, so
  in a worktree (`.git` is a file) `docs:api` dropped every "Defined in" source
  link (259 files changed). The reference was regenerated in a temporary full
  clone of the same tree in the scratchpad and copied back: 64 files, links
  kept (1,712 before, 1,771 after), `diff -r` identical to the clone.
- Evidence (host, diagnostic): `generate-release-posts.ts --check` OK (259
  posts); `bun test test/docs-*.test.ts` 122 / 0; `bun test test/agent-harness`
  22 / 0; version and release tests 74 / 0 (7 files); `check:docs-data` OK;
  `bun run typecheck` and `bun run format:check` clean; `git diff --check`
  clean; `./init.sh` green.
- Gates (exact totals in the `feature_list.json` evidence): `bun run test:sandbox`
  and `bun run test:sandbox:sdk` green on tree `386b8522`; the skeptic then
  required the flow Upgrade notes (docs-only patch, tree `a4146e29`); the
  Ubuntu 24.04 and Debian 13 Machines are green on `a4146e29` except the known
  Bun-only gap of 6 CI-script tests that need `node`
  (`artifacts/machines/20261112T212315Z/manifest.md`), now the
  `ci-script-tests-bun-only-machines` item.
- Next: the push; after publication, `generate-release-posts.ts --refresh` and
  the post's install box and contributors.

### 2026-11-12 — agent-harness

- Built the five-subsystem harness: `CLAUDE.md` (39,046 bytes before) and
  `AGENTS.md` (17,534 bytes before) became routing pages under 12 KiB that keep
  every mandatory rule; the reference sections moved verbatim to `docs/agents/`
  and the test rules to `docs/testing.md#agent-test-rules`; added
  `feature_list.json`, `progress.md`, `session-handoff.md`, `init.sh` and
  `docs/agents/README.md`.
- First skeptic review: `FAIL` (the unit container lacked the harness files, EOF
  blank lines, overclaimed status, a 315-line test file, loose contract checks).
  All fixed in the same uncommitted change; see the evidence below.
- Evidence after the fixes (host only, diagnostic; staged-plus-working tree):
  `bun test test/agent-harness` 22 pass / 0 fail (2 files); `./init.sh` green in
  about 5 s; `bun test test/docs-*.test.ts` 122 / 0;
  `bun test test/sdk-mutation-workflow.test.ts` 1 / 0; `bun run typecheck` and
  `bun run format:check` clean; `git diff --check` and `git diff --cached --check`
  clean; `generate-release-posts.ts --check` OK; course validator 100/100 (32
  before). A simulated test-image layout (`Dockerfile.test` COPY lines over the
  allow-listed context) runs the contract 22 / 0; the pre-fix layout reproduced
  the `ENOENT` failure.
- Second skeptic review: `CONDITIONAL` on the sandbox only. `bun run test:sandbox`
  on the exact staged tree: unit 11668 pass / 0 fail / 398 skip, tcp 553 / 0,
  embedded 349 / 0, no resource anomalies
  (`artifacts/test-sandbox/2026-11-12T20-20-16.500Z/`). `bun run test:model` and
  `bun run test:sandbox:sdk` not triggered (no `src/` or `sdk/` change). The
  remaining minor notes are the `agent-harness-followups` item.
