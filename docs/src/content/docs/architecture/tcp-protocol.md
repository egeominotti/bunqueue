  <p class="bq-hero-sub">bunqueue uses a high-performance binary protocol over TCP with MessagePack serialization and optional pipelining. This page covers the wire format, connection lifecycle, and command set.</p>
</div>

## Wire Format

Each message is a **length-prefixed MessagePack frame**:

| Bytes | Content                                   |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 0-3   | Frame length (4 bytes, big-endian uint32) |
| 4-N   | MessagePack payload                       |

**Maximum frame size:** 64 MB

Both directions preserve frame ordering under socket backpressure. Bun's TCP
write is unbuffered and may accept only a prefix, so the reference client and
server retain the exact unwritten tail and place later frames behind it until
`drain`. Each queue belongs to one physical socket and is discarded on close;
commands are never blindly replayed after reconnect because the broker may
already have applied them.

## TCP Pipelining

Pipelining allows multiple commands to be sent without waiting for responses, dramatically improving throughput.

### Without Pipelining (Sequential)

```
Client                    Server
  │── PUSH job1 ────────────>│
  │<── { ok, id } ───────────│  wait ~1ms
  │── PUSH job2 ────────────>│
  │<── { ok, id } ───────────│  wait ~1ms
  │── PUSH job3 ────────────>│
  │<── { ok, id } ───────────│  wait ~1ms

  Total: 3 round-trips ≈ 3ms
  Throughput: ~1,000 ops/sec (one command per 1ms round-trip)
```

### With Pipelining (Parallel)

```
Client                    Server
  │── PUSH job1 (reqId:1) ──>│
  │── PUSH job2 (reqId:2) ──>│  no wait
  │── PUSH job3 (reqId:3) ──>│  no wait
  │<── { ok, reqId:1 } ──────│
  │<── { ok, reqId:2 } ──────│
  │<── { ok, reqId:3 } ──────│

  Total: 1 round-trip ≈ 1ms
  Throughput: ~3,000 ops/sec (three commands per 1ms round-trip)
```

**Result: 3x faster in this illustrative 1 ms example.** Real throughput depends
on latency, connection count, batching, durability, database size, and storage
backend. The [current benchmark page](/guide/benchmarks/) publishes measured
workloads instead of treating this round-trip sketch as a capacity claim.

### How Pipelining Works

1. **Client sends commands** with unique `reqId` identifiers
2. **Server processes in parallel** (up to 50 concurrent per connection)
3. **Responses include `reqId`** for matching (may arrive out of order)
4. **Client matches responses** using a `Map<reqId, Promise>`

### Configuration

```typescript
const queue = new Queue('my-queue', {
  connection: {
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 6789,
    pipelining: true, // Enable pipelining (default: true)
    maxInFlight: 100, // Max concurrent commands (default: 100)
    poolSize: 32, // Connection pool size
    commandTimeout: 30000, // Timeout per command (ms)
    pingInterval: 30000, // Health-check ping interval (ms, 0 disables)
    maxCommandTimeouts: 3, // Consecutive command timeouts → reconnect (0 disables)
  },
});
```

| Option               | Default | Description                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `pipelining`         | `true`  | Enable TCP pipelining                                                                                                          |
| `maxInFlight`        | `100`   | Max commands in flight per connection                                                                                          |
| `poolSize`           | `4`     | Number of TCP connections                                                                                                      |
| `commandTimeout`     | `30000` | Command timeout (ms)                                                                                                           |
| `pingInterval`       | `30000` | Health-check ping interval (ms, `0` disables)                                                                                  |
| `maxCommandTimeouts` | `3`     | Consecutive command timeouts (no intervening success) before the link is concluded dead and reconnect is forced (`0` disables) |

## Protocol Version Negotiation

On connect, client and server negotiate protocol version:

```typescript
// Client → Server
{ cmd: 'Hello', protocolVersion: 3, capabilities: ['pipelining', 'separate-job-name'] }

// Server → Client
{ ok: true, protocolVersion: 3, capabilities: ['pipelining', 'separate-job-name'], server: 'bunqueue', version: '2.x.y' }
```

Protocol v3 supports pipelining and a separate top-level job `name`, leaving
the user-owned `data` value unchanged. The server accepts clients that omit
`Hello`; legacy job input without top-level `name` is decoded only at the
inbound protocol boundary.

## Connection Lifecycle

**States:**

1. **DISCONNECTED** → Initial state
2. **CONNECTING** → Socket.connect() in progress
3. **CONNECTED** → Ready for commands
4. **RECONNECTING** → Auto-reconnect with backoff

**Connect sequence:**

1. TCP socket connect
2. Send `Hello` (protocol negotiation)
3. Send `Auth` (if token configured)
4. Start ping timer
5. Ready for commands

**Reconnect strategy:**

- Base delay: 100ms
- Max delay: 30s
- Backoff: exponential (2x each attempt)
- Jitter: additive, up to +30% of the computed delay

**Dead-link detection (half-open sockets):**

A socket can go **half-open**, the peer vanishes with no FIN/RST (suspended host,
NAT/load-balancer silently dropping an idle connection). Writes still succeed and no
`close`/`error` event fires, so the client must detect it actively. Two independent
signals conclude the link is dead and trigger `forceReconnect()`:

1. **Health-check ping**, after `maxPingFailures` (3) consecutive failed pings.
2. **Command timeouts**, after `maxCommandTimeouts` (3) consecutive command timeouts
   with no intervening success. This is the path that recovers a worker whose `PULL`s
   keep timing out, without waiting for the slower ping cycle (and it works even when the
   ping is disabled). The counter resets on any successful response.

On detection the socket is torn down, all in-flight commands are rejected immediately
(`Connection lost`) so callers unblock at once, and the reconnect/backoff loop above
re-establishes a fresh connection. `SO_KEEPALIVE` is also enabled so the OS can surface a
dead peer on its own rather than lingering until `tcp_retries2` (~15 min).

For _fast_ recovery, lower `pingInterval` / `commandTimeout`, e.g.
`{ pingInterval: 10000, commandTimeout: 5000 }` recovers in ~tens of seconds vs ~120s on
defaults (each default timeout is 30s, so timeout-based detection is inherently coarse).

## Authentication

If `AUTH_TOKENS` is configured on the server, clients must authenticate:

```typescript
// Client → Server
{ cmd: 'Auth', token: 'your-secret-token' }

// Server → Client
{ ok: true }  // or { ok: false, error: 'Invalid token' }
```

Token comparison uses constant-time algorithm to prevent timing attacks.

overrides. Results are wrapped in `data`; see the [wire reference](/api/tcp/control/#job-group-controls-and-getters)

| `UnregisterWorker` | Unregister worker           |
| `ListWorkers`      | List registered workers     |

## Connection Pool

The client maintains a pool of TCP connections for load balancing:

```typescript
// Default: 4 connections, configurable via poolSize
const pool = new TcpConnectionPool({
  host: 'localhost',
  port: 6789,
  poolSize: 32, // 32 connections for high throughput
});
```

**Selection strategy:** Round-robin, preferring connected sockets.

**Features:**

- Automatic reconnection
- Health tracking (latency, errors)
- Shared pools (reference counted)

## Client Disconnect Handling

When a client disconnects, the server:

1. Identifies all jobs owned by client
2. Releases job locks (returns to queue)
3. Cleans up client tracking

Jobs with active locks are automatically requeued for other workers.
