  <p class="bq-hero-sub">Return the HTTP response now, do the slow work later. This guide wires bunqueue into <a href="https://hono.dev">Hono</a>: enqueue from routes, process in a worker, check job status, shut down cleanly.</p>
</div>

This guide shows how to run background jobs, work your server does after the HTTP response is sent, inside a Hono app. Everything runs in one process using bunqueue's **embedded mode**, configured with `dataPath` so jobs are stored in a local SQLite file instead of a separate queue server.

:::note[Runtime]
This guide runs Hono on Bun with the Bun `bunqueue` package; embedded mode is Bun-only. Running Hono on Node.js or Deno? Start a bunqueue server and use `bunqueue-client` instead, the route and worker code is otherwise the same (see [SDKs](/guide/sdks/)).
:::

## Minimal working app

Copy, run with `bun run app.ts`, done:

```typescript
import { Hono } from 'hono';
import { Queue, Worker, shutdownManager } from 'bunqueue/client';

// Queue: where jobs wait. Worker: runs your function on each job.
const storage = { embedded: true, dataPath: './data/bunq.db' } as const;
const emails = new Queue('emails', storage);

new Worker(
  'emails',
  async (job) => {
    console.log('sending to', job.data.to);
    // await sendEmail(job.data);
    return { sent: true };
  },
  { ...storage, concurrency: 3 }
); // 3 jobs in parallel

const app = new Hono();

app.post('/api/send-email', async (c) => {
  const body = await c.req.json();
  const job = await emails.add('send', body, {
    attempts: 3, // retry up to 3 times on failure
    backoff: 5000, // exponential from a 5s base: ~10s, then ~20s between retries
  });
  return c.json({ queued: true, jobId: job.id });
});

process.on('SIGINT', () => {
  shutdownManager();
  process.exit(0);
});

export default app;
```

The route responds immediately. The worker sends the email in the background and retries automatically if it throws.

:::caution[Embedded mode required]
Every example uses `embedded: true`. Without it, bunqueue tries to connect to a TCP server. Also create each `Queue` once at module level, not inside a request handler.
:::

## Common tasks

### Let clients check job status

Return the job id from the enqueue route, then expose a status endpoint. `job.progress` is a 0-100 number your worker sets, `returnvalue` is what your worker returned, `failedReason` is the last error message:

```typescript
app.get('/api/jobs/:id', async (c) => {
  const job = await emails.getJob(c.req.param('id'));
  if (!job) return c.json({ error: 'Job not found' }, 404);

  return c.json({
    id: job.id,
    name: job.name,
    progress: job.progress,
    result: job.returnvalue ?? null,
    error: job.failedReason ?? null,
  });
});
```

### Report progress from the worker

```typescript
new Worker(
  'reports',
  async (job) => {
    await job.updateProgress(10, 'Fetching data');
    const data = await fetchData(job.data);
    await job.updateProgress(80, 'Rendering PDF');
    const url = await renderPdf(data);
    return { url };
  },
  { embedded: true, dataPath: './data/bunq.db' }
);
```

### Expose queue stats

`getJobCounts()` is synchronous in embedded mode and returns counts per state (`waiting`, `active`, `completed`, `failed`, `delayed`):

```typescript
app.get('/api/queues/emails/stats', (c) => c.json(emails.getJobCounts()));
```

### React to job results

```typescript
const worker = new Worker('emails', processor, {
  embedded: true,
  dataPath: './data/bunq.db',
});

worker.on('completed', (job, result) => console.log('done', job.id));
worker.on('failed', (job, err) => console.error('failed', job.id, err.message));
```

### Share queues through typed middleware

For larger apps, put queues on Hono's context so every route gets them typed:

```typescript
import { Hono } from 'hono';
import type { MiddlewareHandler } from 'hono';
import { Queue } from 'bunqueue/client';

const queues = {
  emails: new Queue('emails', { embedded: true, dataPath: './data/bunq.db' }),
  reports: new Queue('reports', { embedded: true, dataPath: './data/bunq.db' }),
};

type Env = { Variables: { queues: typeof queues } };

const queueMiddleware: MiddlewareHandler<Env> = async (c, next) => {
  c.set('queues', queues);
  await next();
};

const app = new Hono<Env>();
app.use('*', queueMiddleware);

app.post('/api/reports', async (c) => {
  const job = await c.get('queues').reports.add('generate', await c.req.json());
  return c.json({ jobId: job.id });
});
```

### Run workers in a separate process

In production you often want the web server and workers to scale and restart
independently. Start one bunqueue server as the sole owner of the SQLite file,
then connect both processes over TCP:

```bash
bunqueue start --data-path ./data/bunq.db
```

Use the same connection in the Hono app's `Queue` instances and the worker:

```typescript
// In the Hono app
import { Queue } from 'bunqueue/client';

const connection = { host: '127.0.0.1', port: 6789 };
const queues = {
  emails: new Queue('emails', { connection }),
  reports: new Queue('reports', { connection }),
};
```

```typescript
// worker-process.ts (run with: bun run worker-process.ts)
import { Worker } from 'bunqueue/client';

const connection = { host: '127.0.0.1', port: 6789 };

const worker = new Worker(
  'emails',
  async (job) => {
    // ... process job
    return { success: true };
  },
  { connection, concurrency: 5 }
);

process.on('SIGTERM', async () => {
  await worker.close(); // waits for active jobs to finish
  process.exit(0);
});
```

:::note
Never point two embedded processes at the same SQLite file. Multiple clients can
share one SQLite-backed server over TCP; when several active broker processes
must share the queue, use the [PostgreSQL backend](/guide/databases/).
:::

### Shut down cleanly

Close workers first (each `close()` waits for its active jobs), then release the embedded manager:

```typescript
import { shutdownManager } from 'bunqueue/client';

async function shutdown() {
  await Promise.all(workers.map((w) => w.close()));
  shutdownManager();
  process.exit(0);
}

process.on('SIGINT', shutdown);
process.on('SIGTERM', shutdown);
```

## Gotchas

- **One `Queue` instance per queue name, created at startup.** Creating queues inside handlers works but wastes memory and setup time on every request.
- **Bound long jobs with a `timeout`.** Jobs have no processing timeout by default; set one in the job options (for example `timeout: 300_000` for a 5 minute report job), and keep it above the longest legitimate run so a slow job is not failed early.
- **CPU-heavy processors block the event loop**, the single thread Bun uses for all I/O. See [CPU-Intensive Workers](/guide/cpu-intensive-workers/) for yield patterns.
