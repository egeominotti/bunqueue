  <p class="bq-hero-sub">Some jobs are really a sequence: reserve the stock, charge the card, send the confirmation. The workflow engine runs that sequence, retries the flaky parts, resumes after a crash, and when a later step fails it undoes the earlier ones for you.</p>

:::caution[Experimental]
The workflow engine is **experimental**. Its API can change in a patch release, and
this one already does: a `waitFor` inside a `.path()` (by the builder) and a step named
after a loop's `name:index` namespace (at registration) are now rejected instead of being accepted.
Both used to be accepted and neither did what it looked like, so the change is a fix,
but it is still a change to code that previously registered.

Queue, worker, cron, flows and the wire protocol are **not** experimental and follow
semver as usual. The workflow engine is a separate `bunqueue/workflow` entrypoint and
nothing in the core imports it, so its churn cannot reach them.
:::

:::note[Runtime: Bun, in-process]
`bunqueue/workflow` is a Bun API. Your step handlers are TypeScript functions the engine calls directly, so unlike the queue there is no wire protocol for it: it is not exposed over TCP and it is not implemented in the Python, PHP, Go, Rust or Elixir clients, nor on Node. Those clients can still push jobs into a queue that a Bun process running a workflow consumes, which is the usual way to drive one from another language.
:::

## The problem it solves

Write that sequence as plain code and three things go wrong the first time it breaks in production:

1. **The process dies halfway.** The card was charged, the confirmation never went out, and nothing remembers where it got to.
2. **A later step fails after an earlier one already changed the world.** The stock is reserved for an order that will never exist.
3. **A retry runs the effect twice.** Two charges, one order.

A workflow engine exists to make those three cases boring.

<div class="bq-diag">
  <div class="bq-diag-flow">
    <div class="bq-diag-cell">reserve stock <i>compensate: release stock</i></div>
    <div class="bq-diag-arrow">→</div>
    <div class="bq-diag-cell">charge card <i>compensate: refund</i></div>
    <div class="bq-diag-arrow">→</div>
    <div class="bq-diag-cell bq-diag-accent">send confirmation ✗</div>
  </div>
</div>

When `send confirmation` fails, the engine walks back: refund, then release stock. That automatic undo is the **saga pattern**, and each step declares its own inverse with a `compensate` handler.

## The mental model

Three ideas carry everything else:

**A workflow is a list of nodes.** Steps, branches, loops, approval gates. You describe them; the engine walks them.

**Each top-level node gets durable queue delivery.** Finishing one writes its
outcome to SQLite and enqueues the next. Inline branch, parallel and loop body
steps share that node job but persist their own records. On restart, completed
records short-circuit; only work whose outcome is still unknown may replay.

**Failure walks the journal backwards.** The engine already knows which steps completed and in what order, so it can undo them in reverse without asking your code to remember anything.

```typescript
import { Workflow, Engine } from 'bunqueue/workflow';

const flow = new Workflow('checkout')
  .step('reserve', reserveStock,  { compensate: releaseStock })
  .step('charge',  chargeCard,    { compensate: refund })
  .step('confirm', sendEmail);

const engine = new Engine({ embedded: true, dataPath: './data/wf.db' });
engine.register(flow);
await engine.recover();
await engine.start('checkout', { orderId: 'ORD-1' });
```

Everything runs in your process, on bunqueue's Queue and Worker, persisted to SQLite. No extra services, no YAML, no control plane.

For a production service, four details are part of the setup rather than
optional tuning:

1. Pass a durable `dataPath`; omitting it creates an in-memory execution store.
2. Register every definition, then call `recover()` during startup.
3. Make externally visible steps idempotent and pass `ctx.idempotencyKey` to
   providers that support one.
4. Run one workflow `Engine` per process and call `engine.close()` during
   shutdown.

The engine guarantees durable orchestration state, not exactly-once effects in
another system. If a process dies after an API accepted a charge but before the
completed record reached SQLite, the only safe recovery is to replay the call
with the same provider idempotency key.

## Where to go next

| | |
|---|---|
| [Quick Start](/guide/workflow/quickstart/) | Build and run your first workflow |
| [Steps & Control Flow](/guide/workflow/steps/) | Context, retries, branching, parallel, loops |
| [Rollback](/guide/workflow/rollback/) | Compensation, unwind order, the point of no return |
| [Durability](/guide/workflow/durability/) | Idempotency keys, crash recovery, what resumes |
| [Human Approval](/guide/workflow/approval/) | Pausing a run until a person decides |
| [AI Agents](/guide/workflow/ai-agents/) | Durable agent loops with the Vercel AI SDK |
| [API Reference](/guide/workflow/api/) | Engine methods, events, execution shape, limits |

## When *not* to use it

| Situation | Use instead |
|---|---|
| Independent jobs with no ordering | [Queue](/guide/queue/) + [Worker](/guide/worker/) |
| Parent/child fan-out without rollback | [Flow Producer](/guide/flow/), lighter |
| One queue, one processor, a few routes | [Simple Mode](/guide/simple-mode/) |
| Multi-region HA, exactly-once across services | Temporal |

:::note[Runtime]
The workflow engine ships in the Bun `bunqueue` package only; it is not part of the polyglot [SDKs](/guide/sdks/). From other languages, orchestrate multi-step jobs via [flows](/guide/flow/) or call a Bun service that runs the engine.
:::

:::tip[Examples are executable specifications]
The complete engine scenarios are mirrored in
`test/workflow-docs-examples.test.ts` and run against the real engine. The
OpenAI Agents SDK, Claude session seam, Mastra and LangGraph examples are
covered by `test/workflow-agent-sdks.test.ts`; the Vercel AI SDK page has both
offline model tests and an opt-in live script. Short inspection fragments such
as `exec.rollbackStatus` refer to those same tested scenarios rather than
inventing separate pseudo-APIs.
