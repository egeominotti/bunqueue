  <p class="bq-hero-sub">This page shows how to run bunqueue on an edge gateway: turn MQTT sensor messages into persisted jobs, keep them safe while the uplink is down, and forward them to a central server when it comes back.</p>
</div>

bunqueue fits where a Redis + BullMQ stack does not: a single Bun process with one SQLite file, running on the gateway next to your sensors. No containers, no broker for the queue itself.

:::note[Runtime]
Everything on this page uses the Bun `bunqueue` package: embedded mode and `queue.forward()` are Bun-only. The polyglot [SDKs](/guide/sdks/) are not affected, they can still produce and consume on the central server the gateway forwards to.

## Is it the right fit?

| Scenario                                                   | Fit                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Edge gateway (Raspberry Pi 4/5, Jetson, ARM64/x64 mini-PC) | Yes, embedded queue plus store-and-forward                         |
| Backend telemetry ingestion (absorb bursts, retry, DLQ)    | Yes                                                                |
| Offline-first buffering over a flaky uplink                | Yes, jobs persist to SQLite on the gateway                         |
| Replacing an MQTT broker                                   | No, keep Mosquitto/EMQX and bridge into bunqueue                   |
| Running directly on microcontrollers (ESP32, 32-bit ARM)   | No, Bun needs ARM64/x64; those devices publish MQTT to the gateway |

The pattern that works:

```
sensors ──MQTT──► broker (Mosquitto/EMQX) ──► bridge ──► bunqueue ──► Worker
                                                          (SQLite)      │
                                                                        ▼
                                                        backend / TSDB / alerts
```

Devices keep speaking MQTT, their native protocol. A small bridge script subscribes to topics and turns each message into a job. From there you get what a broker alone does not give you: retries with backoff, a dead letter queue (DLQ, a parking lot for messages that failed all retries), priorities, delayed jobs, and a durable buffer when the uplink is down.

## The MQTT bridge

A full runnable version lives in [`examples/mqtt-bridge/`](https://github.com/egeominotti/bunqueue/tree/main/examples/mqtt-bridge). The core is this:

```typescript
import mqtt from 'mqtt';
import { Queue, Worker } from 'bunqueue/client';

// Embedded mode: the queue runs inside this process, no server needed,
// persisted to a SQLite file on the gateway.
const queue = new Queue('telemetry', {
  embedded: true,
  dataPath: './edge-queue.db',
});

const client = mqtt.connect('mqtt://localhost:1883');
client.on('connect', () => client.subscribe('sensors/#'));

client.on('message', (topic, payload) => {
  void queue.add(
    'reading',
    { topic, payload: JSON.parse(payload.toString()), receivedAt: Date.now() },
    { attempts: 5 }
  );
});

// Process locally, or POST to your backend
const worker = new Worker(
  'telemetry',
  async (job) => {
    // write to TSDB, trigger alerts, forward...
    return { processed: true };
  },
  { embedded: true, dataPath: './edge-queue.db', concurrency: 10 }
);
```

Run it:

```bash
bun add mqtt
MQTT_URL=mqtt://localhost:1883 bun examples/mqtt-bridge/index.ts

# publish a test reading
mosquitto_pub -t sensors/temp/room1 -m '{"temp":21.5}'
```

## Forwarding to a central server

The recommended hybrid: the embedded queue on the gateway is the offline buffer, and `queue.forward()` drains it to a central bunqueue server whenever the uplink is healthy.

```typescript
const local = new Queue('telemetry', { embedded: true, dataPath: './edge.db' });

const forwarder = local.forward({
  to: { host: 'queue.example.com', port: 6789, tls: true, token: Bun.env.BQ_TOKEN },
  queue: 'telemetry-ingest', // optional remote queue name (default: same as local)
  concurrency: 4, // parallel forwards (default: 4)
});

forwarder.on('forwarded', ({ id, remoteId }) => console.log(`${id} -> ${remoteId}`));
forwarder.on('error', (err) => console.error('uplink:', err.message));

// later: await forwarder.close();
```

Central server, with native TLS (encrypted connections without a reverse proxy):

```bash
bunqueue start \
  --tls-cert /etc/bunqueue/cert.pem \
  --tls-key /etc/bunqueue/key.pem \
  --auth-tokens "$TOKEN" \
  --data-path /var/lib/bunqueue/queue.db
```

What `forward()` guarantees:

- **An uplink outage does not discard locally persisted work.** If the remote
  push fails, the job fails locally, retries with backoff, and after its attempts
  lands in the local DLQ. When the uplink returns, `local.retryDlq()` re-enqueues
  it. This assumes the gateway process or persistent volume survives; use
  `durable: true` for local jobs that cannot tolerate SQLite's 10ms hard-crash
  window.
- **Re-forwards deduplicate while the remote job is live.** Each forwarded job
  carries a deterministic remote job id, `fwd:<local queue>:<local job id>`, and
  the server treats a second push with that id as a no-op while the remote job
  is waiting, delayed or active. Once it completes or reaches the DLQ the id is
  released, so a re-forward after that creates a new remote job. End-to-end
  processing is at-least-once: make remote processors idempotent.
- **Priority is preserved.** Pass `durable: true` in the forward options to
  bypass a remote SQLite server's write buffer. PostgreSQL admissions are
  already transactional.

TLS certificate setup and client options (custom CA, self-signed) are in the [Native TLS guide](/guide/tls/).

## Offline buffering and durability

The embedded queue persists to SQLite in WAL mode: committed frames use an
append-only sidecar and SQLite recovery preserves transactional consistency
across ordinary process or power interruption. Hardware, filesystem, and
volume durability still belong to the operator. By default writes are batched
for up to 10 ms; for readings you cannot afford to lose inside that window,
mark them durable, meaning committed before `add()` returns:

```typescript
await queue.add('critical-alarm', data, { durable: true });
```

The published native results measure buffered bulk ingestion and sequential
durable adds as different workloads, so do not turn them into one speed ratio.
Both exceed typical sensor rates; use [the benchmark distributions](/guide/benchmarks/)
for capacity planning on your hardware.

## Downsampling on the gateway

Aggregate locally before forwarding, for a cheaper uplink and less central load. This schedules a recurring job every 5 minutes:

```typescript
await queue.upsertJobScheduler(
  'aggregate-5m',
  { every: 5 * 60 * 1000 },
  {
    name: 'aggregate',
    data: { window: '5m' },
  }
);
```

See [Cron & Scheduled Jobs](/guide/cron/) for cron expressions and timezones.

## Hardware notes

- **Runtime**: Bun runs on Linux/macOS ARM64 and x64. Raspberry Pi 4/5 with a 64-bit OS works. 32-bit boards (Pi Zero/2, ESP-class hardware) do not run Bun; those devices publish MQTT to the gateway instead.
- **Disk**: the SQLite file is the main consideration. Bound it with `removeOnComplete` (drop completed jobs), DLQ `maxAge`/`maxEntries`, and periodic `queue.clean(graceMs, limit)`.
- **Backups**: on gateways with object storage access, enable [S3 backup](/guide/backup/), or ship the SQLite file with your own sync.

## Gotchas

- **Forward dedup only covers live jobs.** The server releases a custom job id
  when the remote job completes or moves to the DLQ, whether or not the job
  itself is kept, and its bounded id cache can evict entries earlier. A
  re-forward that arrives after the original finished is accepted as a new job,
  so strict exactly-once effects require downstream idempotency.
- **`forwarder.on('error')` is observability, not control flow.** Failed forwards are already handled by the local retry and DLQ path; the event just tells you the uplink is unhappy.
- **One process per SQLite file.** Run the bridge, worker, and forwarder in the same process (as above), or switch to a local bunqueue server if you need several processes on the gateway.
