<div class="bq-wrap bq-hero">
  <span class="bq-eyebrow">api reference · http</span>
  <h1 class="bq-hero-h1 bq-bench-h1">The HTTP API, every <em>endpoint.</em></h1>
  <p class="bq-hero-sub">The bunqueue HTTP API runs on port <code>6790</code> by default, configurable via the <code>HTTP_PORT</code> environment variable. All request and response bodies use JSON (<code>Content-Type: application/json</code>) unless otherwise noted.</p>
</div>

**Response contract:** Unless an endpoint explicitly documents another media type or shape, JSON command responses include an `ok` boolean. Successful responses return `"ok": true` with operation-specific data; failures return `"ok": false` with an `"error"` string. `GET /queues/summary` is the intentional JSON exception: it returns the summary array directly. Health probe text, Prometheus output, SSE, and WebSocket frames use their documented formats.

```json
// Success
{ "ok": true, "id": "019ce9d7-6983-7000-946f-48737be2b0f9" }

// Error
{ "ok": false, "error": "Job not found" }
```

## Authentication

When `AUTH_TOKENS` is configured, protected endpoints require a Bearer token in
the `Authorization` header. Health probes and CORS preflight stay public;
`/prometheus` is also public unless metrics authentication is enabled. Multiple
tokens are supported, separated by commas.

```bash
# Server configuration (env var)
AUTH_TOKENS=secret-token-1,secret-token-2

# Or in bunqueue.config.ts:
# auth: { tokens: ['secret-token-1', 'secret-token-2'] }

# Client usage
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer secret-token-1" http://localhost:6790/stats
```

Token comparison uses **constant-time equality** (`crypto.timingSafeEqual` equivalent) to prevent timing attacks. Each token is compared against all configured tokens, ensuring no information leaks about token length or prefix.

**Endpoints that skip authentication:**

| Endpoint                    | Reason                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /health`               | Load balancer health checks must work without credentials     |
| `GET /healthz`, `GET /live` | Kubernetes liveness probes                                    |
| `GET /ready`                | Kubernetes readiness probes                                   |
| `GET /prometheus`           | Public by default; protected when `METRICS_AUTH=true`         |
| `OPTIONS *`                 | CORS preflight must respond before auth headers are available |

The `GET /prometheus` endpoint optionally requires auth when `requireAuthForMetrics: true` is set in the server configuration. This allows Prometheus to scrape without credentials in trusted networks, while requiring auth in public-facing deployments.

**Unauthorized response** (`401`):

```json
{ "ok": false, "error": "Unauthorized" }
```

---

## CORS

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is configured via the `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN` environment variable. By default it is unset, meaning no cross-origin access is granted. Set it explicitly, and only to the origins that need browser access (e.g., `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN=https://dashboard.example.com`). See the [Security guide](/security/) for hardening recommendations.

When CORS is configured, all JSON responses include the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. Preflight (`OPTIONS`) requests return:

```
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization
Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400
```

The `Max-Age: 86400` (24 hours) means browsers cache the preflight response, avoiding repeated OPTIONS requests.

---

## Error Responses

All errors follow a consistent format with appropriate HTTP status codes:

| Code  | Meaning        | When                                                                                                         |
| ----- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `200` | Success        | Operation completed successfully                                                                             |
| `400` | Bad Request    | Invalid JSON, missing required fields, validation failure (e.g., queue name too long, priority out of range) |
| `401` | Unauthorized   | Missing or invalid Bearer token                                                                              |
| `404` | Not Found      | Unknown route, or job, cron, webhook, or worker not found                                                    |
| `429` | Rate Limited   | Client exceeded the configured request rate                                                                  |
| `500` | Internal Error | Unexpected server error (logged server-side)                                                                 |
| `503` | Unavailable    | Storage degraded (`/health`, `/ready`), WS/SSE connection limit reached, or `METRICS_AUTH` without tokens    |

Some endpoints, such as `DELETE /jobs/:id`, queue control, DLQ, rate-limit/concurrency, configuration, and `POST /jobs/:id/wait`, report command failures with status `200` and `"ok": false`, so always check `ok`.

**Error response body:**

```json
{ "ok": false, "error": "Queue name contains invalid characters" }
```

**Validation rules applied to all endpoints:**

- **Queue names**: 1-256 characters, alphanumeric + `-_.:`
- **Numeric fields**: Validated for type, range, and finiteness (e.g., `delay` must be 0 to 365 days, `priority` must be -1M to +1M)
- **Job data**: Max 10MB per job payload
- **Job IDs**: UUID v7 format (auto-generated) or custom string (via `jobId` field)

---

## Rate Limiting

HTTP requests are rate-limited per client IP using a **sliding window** algorithm. The client IP is resolved in order: `X-Forwarded-For` header (first IP) > `X-Real-IP` header > `"unknown"`.

| Variable                  | Default | Description                                         |
| ------------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS`    | `60000` | Sliding window duration in milliseconds             |
| `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS` | `10000` | Maximum requests per window per IP.                 |
| `RATE_LIMIT_CLEANUP_MS`   | `60000` | Interval for cleaning up expired rate limit entries |

When rate limited, the server responds with:

```json
{ "ok": false, "error": "Rate limit exceeded" }
```

Status code: `429`. The client should implement exponential backoff before retrying.

:::note
This is HTTP-level rate limiting per client IP. For per-queue job throughput limiting, use the [Queue Rate Limit](#set-rate-limit) endpoints.

## Job Lifecycle

Understanding the job lifecycle is essential for using the API effectively. A job flows through these states:

<div class="bq-diag">
  <div class="bq-diag-head"><b>Job lifecycle</b><span>states and transitions</span></div>
  <div class="bq-diag-flow">
    <div class="bq-diag-cell">push <i>priority &le; 0</i></div>
    <div class="bq-diag-arrow">→</div>
    <div class="bq-diag-cell">waiting</div>
  </div>
  <div class="bq-diag-flow">
    <div class="bq-diag-cell">push <i>priority &gt; 0</i></div>
    <div class="bq-diag-arrow">→</div>
    <div class="bq-diag-cell">prioritized</div>
  </div>
  <div class="bq-diag-flow">
    <div class="bq-diag-cell">push <i>delay &gt; 0</i></div>
    <div class="bq-diag-arrow">→</div>
    <div class="bq-diag-cell">delayed</div>
    <div class="bq-diag-arrow">→</div>
    <div class="bq-diag-cell">waiting / prioritized <i>delay expires</i></div>
  </div>
  <div class="bq-diag-arrow">↓ pull</div>
  <div class="bq-diag-cell bq-diag-accent">active</div>
  <div class="bq-diag-arrow">↓</div>
  <div class="bq-diag-row">
    <div class="bq-diag-cell">completed <i>ack</i></div>
    <div class="bq-diag-cell">failed <i>fail (terminal)</i></div>
    <div class="bq-diag-cell">waiting / prioritized <i>retry</i></div>
  </div>
  <div class="bq-diag-group">
    <span class="bq-diag-group-label">flow dependencies</span>
    <div class="bq-diag-flow">
      <div class="bq-diag-cell">active</div>
      <div class="bq-diag-arrow">→</div>
      <div class="bq-diag-cell">waiting-children</div>
      <div class="bq-diag-arrow">→</div>
      <div class="bq-diag-cell">waiting <i>all children complete</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

**States:**

- **waiting**, Job is queued with priority ≤ 0
- **prioritized**, Job is queued with priority > 0 (processed before waiting jobs)
- **delayed**, Job waiting for its delay to expire, then moves to waiting/prioritized
- **active**, Job is being processed by a worker
- **completed**, Job finished successfully
- **failed**, Job failed after all retries (stored in DLQ with attempt history)
- **waiting-children**, Parent job waiting for child flow jobs to complete

**Delayed jobs:** When `delay > 0` is set at push time, the job enters `delayed` state and becomes `waiting` (or `prioritized` if priority > 0) after the delay expires. A delayed job can be promoted immediately via the Promote endpoint.

**Durable mode:** In SQLite mode, `durable: true` writes the job synchronously
before returning. Without it, jobs use the 10ms in-memory write buffer for
higher throughput, with a small window of potential data loss on a hard crash.
PostgreSQL admissions are transactional regardless of this flag and never use
the SQLite buffer.

## Jobs

### Push a Job

Add a new job to a queue. The job enters `waiting` state (or `delayed` if `delay > 0`).

```
POST /queues/:queue/jobs
```

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:6790/queues/emails/jobs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "data": {"to": "user@test.com", "subject": "Welcome"},
    "priority": 10,
    "delay": 5000
  }'
```

**Request body**, only `data` is required:

| Field              | Type                 | Default      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `data`             | `any`                | _(required)_ | Job payload. Any JSON-serializable value. Max 10MB.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `name`             | `string`             | `"default"`  | Job name, stored as the top-level `job.name`.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `priority`         | `number`             | `0`          | Higher value = processed sooner. Range: -1,000,000 to 1,000,000.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `delay`            | `number`             | `0`          | Milliseconds before the job becomes available for processing. Max: 1 year.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `maxAttempts`      | `number`             | `3`          | Maximum retry attempts before the job moves to the DLQ. Range: 1-1000. `attempts` is accepted as an alias.                                                                                                                                         |
| `backoff`          | `number` or `object` | `1000`       | Base retry delay in milliseconds (exponential: `backoff * 2^attempt`, max: 1 day). Also accepts `{ "type": "fixed" \| "exponential", "delay": ms, "maxDelay": ms }`; the optional `maxDelay` (0 to 1 day) caps each retry delay (default: 1 hour). |
| `ttl`              | `number`             | -            | Time-to-live from creation in milliseconds. Job is discarded if not processed within this window. Max: 1 year.                                                                                                                                     |
| `timeout`          | `number`             | -            | Processing timeout in milliseconds. The broker fails the active attempt at its absolute deadline; a later outcome from that lease generation is ignored. Max: 1 day.                                                                               |
| `uniqueKey`        | `string`             | -            | Deduplication key. If a job with the same `uniqueKey` already exists in the queue, the push is silently ignored.                                                                                                                                   |
| `jobId`            | `string`             | -            | Broker-wide custom job ID. If a live job with this ID already exists in any queue, the push is idempotent and returns the existing ID.                                                                                                             |
| `tags`             | `string[]`           | `[]`         | Metadata tags for filtering and querying.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `groupId`          | `string`             | -            | Job-group identifier. Claims use ascending group priority with FIFO ties and round-robin across groups; execution is concurrent unless a Worker supplies a group concurrency cap.                                                                  |
| `lifo`             | `boolean`            | `false`      | Last-in-first-out ordering. When true, the job is processed before other jobs at the same priority.                                                                                                                                                |
| `removeOnComplete` | `boolean`            | `false`      | Automatically remove the job from memory after completion. Saves memory for fire-and-forget jobs.                                                                                                                                                  |
| `removeOnFail`     | `boolean`            | `false`      | Automatically remove the job after final failure (after all retries exhausted).                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `durable`          | `boolean`            | `false`      | SQLite: bypass the write buffer and commit before returning (slower, but no 10 ms buffer-loss window). PostgreSQL admissions are already transactional and do not use the SQLite buffer.                                                           |
| `dependsOn`        | `string[]`           | `[]`         | Job IDs that must complete before this job becomes available. The job enters `waiting-children` state until all dependencies are met.                                                                                                              |
| `repeat`           | `object`             | -            | Repeat configuration: `{ every: ms, limit: n }` for interval-based, or `{ pattern: "cron expression" }` for cron-based (optional `tz`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `immediately`).                                                                     |

**Success response** (`200`):

```json
{ "ok": true, "id": "019ce9d7-6983-7000-946f-48737be2b0f9" }
```

The `id` is a UUID v7 (time-ordered, sortable). If `jobId` was provided and a
live job with that broker-wide ID already exists, including in another queue,
the existing job's ID is returned (idempotent).

**Error responses:**

| Status | Error                                    | Cause                                        |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |

### Push Jobs in Bulk

Push multiple jobs to a queue in a single round-trip. More efficient than individual pushes, all jobs are inserted in a single batch operation.

```
POST /queues/:queue/jobs/bulk
```

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:6790/queues/emails/jobs/bulk \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jobs": [
      {"data": {"to": "user1@test.com"}, "priority": 5},
      {"data": {"to": "user2@test.com"}},
      {"data": {"to": "user3@test.com"}, "delay": 60000}
    ]
  }'
```

Each item in `jobs` supports the same fields as a single push and is validated with the same rules (option bounds and `dependsOn` existence; a `dependsOn` entry may also reference the `customId` of any job in the same batch, in any order). Two differences: the custom ID field is `customId` (not `jobId`), and the `attempts` alias is not accepted (use `maxAttempts`). Validation is all-or-nothing: if any job fails validation, the whole batch is rejected with an error naming the offending index (`jobs[i]: ...`) and nothing is pushed. A runtime admission error after validation, such as a full group (`group.maxSize`) or an unresolved custom-ID dependency, can leave the jobs accepted before it pushed, so check which IDs exist before you resubmit.

**Response** (`200`):

```json
{ "ok": true, "ids": ["id-1", "id-2", "id-3"] }
```

IDs are returned in the same order as the input jobs.

---

### Pull a Job

Pull the next available job from a queue for processing. The job transitions from `waiting` to `active` state. Respects priority ordering (higher priority first) and FIFO within the same priority.

```
GET /queues/:queue/jobs[?timeout=ms]
```

```bash
# Immediate return (no wait), returns null if queue is empty
curl http://localhost:6790/queues/emails/jobs

# Long-poll for up to 5 seconds, waits for a job to become available
curl http://localhost:6790/queues/emails/jobs?timeout=5000
```

| Parameter | Type     | Default | Max     | Description                                                            |
| --------- | -------- | ------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `timeout` | `number` | `0`     | `60000` | Long-poll timeout in ms. `0` = return immediately if no job available. |

**Response with job** (`200`):

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "job": {
    "id": "019ce9d7-6983-7000-946f-48737be2b0f9",
    "queue": "emails",
    "data": { "to": "user@test.com", "subject": "Welcome" },
    "priority": 10,
    "createdAt": 1700000000000,
    "runAt": 1700000000000,
    "attempts": 0,
    "maxAttempts": 3,
    "backoff": 1000,
    "progress": 0,
    "tags": [],
    "lifo": false,
    "removeOnComplete": false,
    "removeOnFail": false
  }
}
```

**No job available** (`200`):

```json
{ "ok": true, "job": null }
```

**Behavior notes:**

- Paused queues return `null` even if jobs exist
- HTTP is stateless, so a pulled job is not tied to the client connection. If the client never ACKs or fails it, the stall detector eventually recovers the job (retry, or DLQ after `maxStalls`)
- Rate-limited queues may return `null` even if jobs exist (rate limit exceeded)
- Per-group concurrency: if the job's `groupId` has reached its concurrency limit, the next job from a different group is returned

---

### Pull Jobs in Batch

Pull multiple jobs at once. More efficient than individual pulls for high-throughput workers.

```
POST /queues/:queue/jobs/pull-batch
```

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:6790/queues/emails/jobs/pull-batch \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"count": 10, "timeout": 5000}'
```

| Field     | Type     | Required | Range   | Description                                                                              |
| --------- | -------- | -------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `count`   | `number` | Yes      | 1-1000  | Number of jobs to pull                                                                   |
| `timeout` | `number` | No       | 0-60000 | Long-poll timeout (ms), honored with or without `owner`. Default 0 (return immediately). |
| `owner`   | `string` | No       | -       | Lock owner identifier for lock-based processing                                          |
| `lockTtl` | `number` | No       | -       | Lock time-to-live (ms). Job is released if lock expires without ACK.                     |

**Response** (`200`):

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "jobs": [
    {"id": "id-1", "queue": "emails", "data": {...}, "priority": 5, ...},
    {"id": "id-2", "queue": "emails", "data": {...}, "priority": 3, ...}
  ]
}
```

Returns fewer jobs than `count` if the queue doesn't have enough available jobs.

---

### Get a Job

Retrieve a job by ID. Returns the full job object regardless of state (waiting, active, delayed, completed).

```
GET /jobs/:id
```

```bash
curl http://localhost:6790/jobs/019ce9d7-6983-7000-946f-48737be2b0f9
```

**Response** (`200`):

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "job": {
    "id": "019ce9d7-6983-7000-946f-48737be2b0f9",
    "queue": "emails",
    "data": { "to": "user@test.com" },
    "priority": 0,
    "createdAt": 1700000000000,
    "runAt": 1700000000000,
    "startedAt": 1700000001000,
    "completedAt": null,
    "attempts": 1,
    "maxAttempts": 3,
    "backoff": 1000,
    "progress": 50,
    "tags": ["onboarding"],
    "lifo": false,
    "removeOnComplete": false,
    "removeOnFail": false
  }
}
```

**Not found** (`404`): `{ "ok": false, "error": "Job not found" }`

:::note
Jobs with `removeOnComplete: true` or `removeOnFail: true` are permanently deleted after completion/failure and cannot be retrieved.
:::

---

### Get Job by Custom ID

Look up a job using the custom `jobId` that was set at push time. Useful for idempotent workflows where you generate your own IDs.

```
GET /jobs/custom/:customId
```

```bash
curl http://localhost:6790/jobs/custom/order-12345
```

Returns the same response format as `GET /jobs/:id`.

---

### Get Job State

```
GET /jobs/:id/state
```

```json
{ "ok": true, "id": "019ce9d7-...", "state": "active" }
```

Possible states: `waiting`, `prioritized`, `delayed`, `active`, `waiting-children`, `completed`, `failed`, `unknown` (job not found)

---

### Get Job Result

Retrieve the result stored when a job was acknowledged. Only available for completed jobs.

```
GET /jobs/:id/result
```

```json
{ "ok": true, "id": "019ce9d7-...", "result": { "sent": true, "messageId": "abc-123" } }
```

Results are stored in an LRU cache (max 10,000 entries by default). Oldest results are evicted when the cache is full. For permanent result storage, use the `result` field in your own database.

---

### Cancel a Job

Remove a queued job. Works on `waiting`, `prioritized`, `delayed`, and `waiting-children` jobs. Active jobs cannot be cancelled.

```
DELETE /jobs/:id
```

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:6790/jobs/019ce9d7-...
```

**Response** (`200`): `{ "ok": true }`

If the job does not exist or is not queued (for example, it is `active` or already finished), the response is still `200` with `{ "ok": false, "error": "Job not found or cannot be cancelled" }`.

---

### Acknowledge a Job

Mark a job as successfully completed. The job transitions from `active` to `completed` state. Optionally store a result that can be retrieved later via `GET /jobs/:id/result`.

```
POST /jobs/:id/ack
```

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:6790/jobs/019ce9d7-.../ack \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"result": {"sent": true, "messageId": "abc-123"}}'
```

**Request body** (optional):

| Field    | Type     | Description                                          |
| -------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `result` | `any`    | Completion result. Stored in LRU cache (10,000 max). |
| `token`  | `string` | Lock token (if using lock-based processing).         |

**Response** (`200`): `{ "ok": true }`

**Error** (`400`): `{ "ok": false, "error": "Job not found or not in processing state: <id>" }`

**What happens on ACK:**

1. Job is removed from the `active` processing queue
2. Result is stored in the LRU cache (if provided)
3. Completion counter incremented
4. `job:completed` event broadcast to all subscribers
5. `queue:counts` event broadcast with updated counts
6. Dependent jobs (via `dependsOn`) are checked and promoted if all dependencies are met
7. If `removeOnComplete: true`, the job is permanently deleted from memory

---

### Acknowledge Jobs in Batch

Acknowledge multiple jobs in a single round-trip.

```
POST /jobs/ack-batch
```

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:6790/jobs/ack-batch \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"ids": ["id-1", "id-2", "id-3"], "results": [{"a": 1}, null, {"c": 3}]}'
```

| Field     | Type        | Required | Description                                       |
| --------- | ----------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `ids`     | `string[]`  | Yes      | Job IDs to acknowledge                            |
| `results` | `unknown[]` | No       | Per-job results (positional, same order as `ids`) |
| `tokens`  | `string[]`  | No       | Lock tokens (positional)                          |

---

### Fail a Job

Mark a job as failed. If retry attempts remain, the job is automatically re-queued with exponential backoff (`backoff * 2^attempt`). If all attempts are exhausted, the job moves to the Dead Letter Queue (DLQ).

```
POST /jobs/:id/fail
```

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:6790/jobs/019ce9d7-.../fail \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"error": "SMTP connection refused"}'
```

| Field           | Type       | Description                                                   |
| --------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `error`         | `string`   | Error message. Stored with the job for debugging.             |
| `token`         | `string`   | Lock token (if using lock-based processing).                  |
| `unrecoverable` | `boolean`  | Skip remaining retries and fail terminally (straight to DLQ). |
| `stack`         | `string[]` | Stack trace lines, stored on the job and its DLQ entry.       |

**Retry behavior:**

<div class="bq-diag">
  <div class="bq-diag-head"><b>Retry behavior</b><span>exponential backoff</span></div>
  <div class="bq-diag-flow">
    <div class="bq-diag-cell">Attempt 1 fails</div>
    <div class="bq-diag-arrow">→</div>
    <div class="bq-diag-cell">wait ~2s <i>backoff * 2</i></div>
    <div class="bq-diag-arrow">→</div>
    <div class="bq-diag-cell">retry</div>
  </div>
  <div class="bq-diag-flow">
    <div class="bq-diag-cell">Attempt 2 fails</div>
    <div class="bq-diag-arrow">→</div>
    <div class="bq-diag-cell">wait ~4s <i>backoff * 4</i></div>
    <div class="bq-diag-arrow">→</div>
    <div class="bq-diag-cell">retry</div>
  </div>
  <div class="bq-diag-flow">
    <div class="bq-diag-cell">Attempt 3 fails</div>
    <div class="bq-diag-arrow">→</div>
    <div class="bq-diag-cell bq-diag-accent">move to DLQ <i>maxAttempts reached</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

With a numeric `backoff` (default `1000`, `maxAttempts` `3`), the retry delay is `backoff * 2^attempt`, where `attempt` is the number of failed attempts so far, multiplied by a random jitter factor between 0.5 and 1.5 and capped at 1 hour. With `{ "type": "fixed", "delay": ms }` the delay is `delay` with ±20% jitter. The object form also accepts `maxDelay` (0 to 86,400,000 ms), which replaces the 1-hour cap for that job: `{ "type": "exponential", "delay": 1000, "maxDelay": 30000 }` never waits more than 30 seconds between attempts. An invalid `maxDelay` is rejected with `400`.

---

### Update Job Data

Edit the JSON payload of a job in-place. Works on jobs in `waiting`, `delayed`, or `active` state. Useful for modifying job parameters before processing or while a job is being retried.

```
PUT /jobs/:id/data
```

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:6790/jobs/019ce9d7-.../data \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"data": {"to": "new@email.com", "subject": "Updated subject"}}'
```

The entire `data` field is replaced (not merged). To update a single field, read the current data first, modify it, then PUT the full object.

**Broadcasts:** `job:data-updated` event.

---

### Change Job Priority

Change the priority of a job in `waiting` or `delayed` state. Higher priority = processed sooner.

```
PUT /jobs/:id/priority
```

```json
{ "priority": 100 }
```

The job is repositioned in the priority queue immediately. Does not work on `active` jobs (they're already being processed).

**Broadcasts:** `job:priority-changed` event with `{ jobId, newPriority }`.

---

### Promote a Delayed Job

Move a job from `delayed` to `waiting` state for immediate processing. The job becomes available for the next `PULL` operation.

```
POST /jobs/:id/promote
```

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:6790/jobs/019ce9d7-.../promote
```

**Error** (`400`): `{ "ok": false, "error": "Job not found or not delayed" }`, returned if the job doesn't exist, is already in `waiting` state, or is `active`.

**Broadcasts:** `job:promoted` event.

---

### Move to Waiting

Move a job back to `waiting`, dispatching on its current state: an `active` job is released back to the queue, a `delayed` job is promoted, a `failed` job is retried from the DLQ, and a `waiting`/`prioritized` job is a successful no-op. Other states return an error.

```
POST /jobs/:id/move-to-wait
```

```json
{ "token": "lock-token" }
```

`token` is optional; it is required only for an active job that holds a lock.

---

### Move to Delayed

Move an `active` job back to `delayed` state. Useful when a worker determines it can't process the job right now but doesn't want to fail it.

```
POST /jobs/:id/move-to-delayed
```

```json
{ "delay": 60000 }
```

The job will become `waiting` again after `delay` milliseconds.

---

### Change Delay

Update the delay of a `delayed` job. The job's `runAt` time is recalculated.

```
PUT /jobs/:id/delay
```

```json
{ "delay": 30000 }
```

**Broadcasts:** `job:delay-changed` event with `{ jobId, newDelay }`.

---

### Discard to DLQ

Move a job directly to the Dead Letter Queue, bypassing the normal retry mechanism. Works on `waiting`, `delayed`, and `active` jobs.

```
POST /jobs/:id/discard
```

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:6790/jobs/019ce9d7-.../discard
```

**Broadcasts:** `job:discarded` event.

---

### Wait for Job Completion

Long-poll until a job completes or the timeout expires. This is **event-driven** (not polling), the server subscribes to the job's completion event internally and resolves immediately when the job finishes.

```
POST /jobs/:id/wait
```

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:6790/jobs/019ce9d7-.../wait \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"timeout": 30000}'
```

| Field     | Type     | Default | Description                                     |
| --------- | -------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `timeout` | `number` | `30000` | Maximum wait time in milliseconds (max: 600000) |

**Completed within timeout:**

```json
{ "ok": true, "completed": true, "result": { "sent": true } }
```

**Timed out:**

```json
{ "ok": true, "completed": false }
```

**Not found:**

```json
{ "ok": false, "error": "Job not found" }
```

If the job is already completed when the request arrives, the result is returned immediately without waiting.

---

### Get/Update Job Progress

Workers can report progress (0-100) during long-running jobs. The dashboard can display this as a progress bar.

**Get current progress:**

```
GET /jobs/:id/progress
```

```json
{ "ok": true, "progress": 75, "message": "Processing attachments..." }
```

**Update progress:**

```
POST /jobs/:id/progress
```

```json
{ "progress": 75, "message": "Processing attachments..." }
```

Progress is stored on the job object and broadcast as a `job:progress` event to all WebSocket subscribers.

---

### Get Children Values

For a flow parent job (one created with children, for example by FlowProducer), retrieve the stored results of its completed children. Keys are `<queue>:<childId>`, or the bare `childId` when the child job no longer exists.

```
GET /jobs/:id/children
```

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": { "values": { "emails:child-job-1": { "sent": true }, "emails:child-job-2": { "sent": true } } }
}
```

---

### Job Heartbeat

Send a heartbeat to prevent the stall detector from marking the job as stalled. Workers should send heartbeats at regular intervals (default: every 10 seconds) for long-running jobs.

```
POST /jobs/:id/heartbeat
```

```json
{ "token": "lock-token", "duration": 30000 }
```

Both fields are optional. If the job doesn't exist or isn't active, returns an error.

**Batch heartbeat:**

```
POST /jobs/heartbeat-batch
```

```json
{ "ids": ["id-1", "id-2"], "tokens": ["tok-1", "tok-2"] }
```

---

### Extend Lock

Extend the lock TTL on an active job. Used in lock-based processing where a worker holds a lock on a job and needs more time.

```
POST /jobs/:id/extend-lock
```

```json
{ "duration": 30000, "token": "lock-token" }
```

**Batch extend:**

```
POST /jobs/extend-locks
```

```json
{ "ids": ["id-1", "id-2"], "tokens": ["tok-1", "tok-2"], "durations": [30000, 60000] }
```

---

### Job Logs

Structured logging attached to individual jobs. Useful for debugging failed jobs, each log entry has a level and message.

**Add a log entry:**

```
POST /jobs/:id/logs
```

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:6790/jobs/019ce9d7-.../logs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Connecting to SMTP server...", "level": "info"}'
```

| Field     | Type     | Required | Description                          |
| --------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `message` | `string` | Yes      | Log message                          |
| `level`   | `string` | No       | `info` (default), `warn`, or `error` |

Logs are stored in an LRU cache (max 100 entries per job, 10,000 jobs total).

**Get all logs:**

```
GET /jobs/:id/logs
```

**Clear logs:**

```
DELETE /jobs/:id/logs
```

---

## Queues

### List All Queues

Returns all queue names that have had at least one job pushed to them. Queue names persist until the queue is obliterated.

```
GET /queues
```

```json
{ "ok": true, "queues": ["emails", "notifications", "reports"] }
```

---

### Queues Summary

All queues with paused state and per-state counts in a single call (one round-trip instead of N).

```
GET /queues/summary
```

```json
[
  {
    "name": "emails",
    "paused": false,
    "counts": {
      "waiting": 125,
      "prioritized": 7,
      "active": 5,
      "completed": 10234,
      "failed": 23,
      "delayed": 2
    }
  }
]
```

Note: this endpoint returns a bare JSON array (no `ok` wrapper).

---

### List Workers for a Queue

Workers currently registered for a specific queue.

```
GET /queues/:queue/workers
```

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "workers": [
    {
      "id": "w-1",
      "name": "email-worker",
      "queues": ["emails"],
      "concurrency": 5,
      "registeredAt": 1700000000000,
      "lastSeen": 1700000010000,
      "activeJobs": 3,
      "processedJobs": 1500,
      "failedJobs": 12
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### List Jobs by State

Paginated listing of jobs in a specific queue, filtered by state.

```
GET /queues/:queue/jobs/list[?status=waiting&limit=10&offset=0]
```

```bash
curl "http://localhost:6790/queues/emails/jobs/list?status=waiting&limit=20&offset=0"
# multiple states (comma-separated or repeated):
curl "http://localhost:6790/queues/emails/jobs/list?status=failed,completed"
```

| Parameter | Type     | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                             |
| --------- | -------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `status`  | `string` | all     | State filter: `waiting`, `prioritized`, `delayed`, `active`, `completed`, `failed`, `waiting-children`. Aliases: `state`, `states`. Repeatable and comma-separated for multiple states. |
| `limit`   | `number` | `100`   | Max jobs to return                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `offset`  | `number` | `0`     | Skip first N jobs                                                                                                                                                                       |

**Response** (`200`):

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "jobs": [
    {"id": "...", "queue": "emails", "data": {...}, "priority": 5, "createdAt": 1700000000000, "runAt": 1700000000000, "attempts": 0, "progress": 0}
  ]
}
```

Jobs are ordered by `createdAt` ascending (oldest first), with the job ID as a deterministic tie-breaker. State filtering happens before `offset` and `limit`, so pages are stable even when `createdAt` values match.

---

### Get Job Counts

Returns the number of jobs in each state for a specific queue.

```
GET /queues/:queue/counts
```

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "counts": {
    "waiting": 150,
    "prioritized": 0,
    "active": 12,
    "delayed": 30,
    "completed": 5000,
    "failed": 3,
    "waiting-children": 4,
    "paused": 0
  }
}
```

:::tip
For real-time count updates without polling, subscribe to `queue:counts` via [WebSocket pub/sub](#websocket-pubsub). A count refresh is scheduled after job lifecycle events; updates for the same queue within 10ms are coalesced into one latest-value event.
:::

---

### Get Queued Count

Returns the number of queued jobs (`waiting`, `prioritized`, and `delayed`) in a queue. Active, completed, and failed jobs are not counted.

```
GET /queues/:queue/count
```

```json
{ "ok": true, "count": 180 }
```

---

### Get Counts per Priority

Returns a breakdown of jobs by priority level. Useful for dashboards showing priority distribution.

```
GET /queues/:queue/priority-counts
```

```json
{ "ok": true, "queue": "emails", "counts": { "0": 100, "5": 30, "10": 12 } }
```

---

### Check If Paused

```
GET /queues/:queue/paused
```

```json
{ "ok": true, "paused": false }
```

---

### Pause a Queue

Stop processing new jobs from this queue. Active jobs continue to completion, only new pulls are blocked.

```
POST /queues/:queue/pause
```

**Broadcasts:** `queue:paused` event.

---

### Resume a Queue

Resume processing after a pause.

```
POST /queues/:queue/resume
```

**Broadcasts:** `queue:resumed` event.

---

### Drain a Queue

Remove **all** `waiting` and `delayed` jobs from a queue. Active jobs are not affected, they continue processing normally. This is useful for clearing a backlog without affecting in-progress work.

```
POST /queues/:queue/drain
```

```json
{ "ok": true, "count": 150 }
```

**Broadcasts:** `queue:drained` event with `{ queue, count }`.

---

### Obliterate a Queue

Completely destroy a queue and all its jobs (waiting, delayed, and metadata). Active jobs continue but their ACK/FAIL will be no-ops.

```
POST /queues/:queue/obliterate
```

:::caution
This is **irreversible**. All jobs in the queue are permanently deleted. The queue name is removed from the queue list.
:::

**Broadcasts:** `queue:obliterated` event.

---

### Clean a Queue

Remove jobs older than a grace period, optionally filtered by state. Useful for maintenance, cleaning up old waiting/delayed jobs that are no longer relevant.

```
POST /queues/:queue/clean
```

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:6790/queues/emails/clean \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"grace": 86400000, "state": "waiting", "limit": 500}'
```

| Field   | Type     | Default | Description                                                                                                   |
| ------- | -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `grace` | `number` | `0`     | Only remove jobs older than this many milliseconds. `0` = remove all.                                         |
| `state` | `string` | queued  | `waiting`/`delayed`/`prioritized`/`paused` (all clean the queued set, the default), `completed`, or `failed`. |
| `limit` | `number` | `1000`  | Max jobs to remove per call.                                                                                  |

**Response** (`200`):

```json
{ "ok": true, "count": 42, "ids": ["019ce9d7-...", "..."] }
```

Uses a temporal index for efficient O(log n + k) cleanup instead of full queue scan.

**Broadcasts:** `queue:cleaned` event with `{ queue, state, count }`.

---

### Promote All Delayed Jobs

Move all (or up to N) delayed jobs in a queue to `waiting` state immediately.

```
POST /queues/:queue/promote-jobs
```

```json

```

```json
{ "id": "specific-job-id" }
```

Omit `id` to retry all completed jobs in the queue.

---

## Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)

Jobs that exhaust all retry attempts or are explicitly discarded land in the DLQ. Each queue has its own DLQ. DLQ entries include the original job data, failure reason, and timestamp.

### List DLQ Jobs

```
GET /queues/:queue/dlq[?limit=100&offset=0]
```

| Parameter | Type     | Default | Description           |
| --------- | -------- | ------- | --------------------- |
| `limit`   | `number` | all     | Max entries to return |
| `offset`  | `number` | `0`     | Skip first N entries  |

Returns full DLQ entries (original job + failure metadata) under `entries`, plus the `total` count for pagination:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "entries": [
    {
      "job": { "id": "...", "data": {}, "attempts": 3 },
      "enteredAt": 1700000000000,
      "reason": "max_attempts_exceeded",
      "error": "SMTP timeout",
      "attempts": [
        {
          "attempt": 1,
          "startedAt": 1700000000000,
          "failedAt": 1700000001000,
          "reason": "explicit_fail",
          "error": "SMTP timeout",
          "duration": 1000
        }
      ],
      "retryCount": 0
    }
  ],
  "total": 1
}
```

Omit `limit`/`offset` to return all entries.

---

### DLQ Stats

Aggregated DLQ statistics for a queue.

```
GET /queues/:queue/dlq/stats
```

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "stats": {
    "total": 12,
    "byReason": {
      "explicit_fail": 4,
      "max_attempts_exceeded": 6,
      "timeout": 1,
      "stalled": 1,
      "ttl_expired": 0,
      "worker_lost": 0,
      "unknown": 0
    },
    "byQueue": { "emails": 12 },
    "pendingRetry": 0,
    "expired": 0,
    "oldestEntry": 1700000000000,
    "newestEntry": 1700003600000
  }
}
```

---

### Retry DLQ Jobs

Re-queue jobs from the DLQ back to the main queue for reprocessing. The job's attempt counter is reset.

```
POST /queues/:queue/dlq/retry
```

```json
{ "jobId": "specific-job-id" }
```

Omit `jobId` to retry **all** DLQ jobs. Returns `{ "ok": true, "count": 5 }`.

**Broadcasts:** `dlq:retried` (single) or `dlq:retry-all` (all) event.

---

### Purge DLQ

Remove all jobs from the DLQ permanently. This is irreversible.

```
POST /queues/:queue/dlq/purge
```

```json
{ "ok": true, "count": 12 }
```

**Broadcasts:** `dlq:purged` event with `{ queue, count }`.

---

## Rate Limiting & Concurrency

Per-queue controls for throughput and parallelism. These are queue-level settings, independent of HTTP rate limiting.

### Set Rate Limit

Limit the number of jobs that can be processed from a queue: `limit` jobs per `duration` ms (default 1000, so jobs per second).

```
PUT /queues/:queue/rate-limit
```

```json
{ "limit": 100, "duration": 60000, "ttl": 30000 }
```

`duration` and `ttl` are optional. `duration` sets the window in ms; `ttl` makes the limit temporary, the server clears it by itself after that many ms. Invalid values fall back to the defaults (1 second window, permanent limit).

When the rate limit is hit, workers pulling from this queue receive `null` until the next window opens.

**Broadcasts:** `ratelimit:set` event.

### Clear Rate Limit

```
DELETE /queues/:queue/rate-limit
```

**Broadcasts:** `ratelimit:cleared` event.

### Set Concurrency Limit

Limit the number of jobs that can be processed simultaneously from a queue.

```
PUT /queues/:queue/concurrency
```

```json
{ "concurrency": 5 }
```

Accepts either `concurrency` (natural for this endpoint) or `limit`. A non-numeric value is rejected.

**Broadcasts:** `concurrency:set` event.

### Clear Concurrency Limit

```
DELETE /queues/:queue/concurrency
```

**Broadcasts:** `concurrency:cleared` event.

---

## Queue Configuration

### Stall Detection

Stall detection identifies jobs that a worker started processing but never acknowledged. This can happen when a worker crashes, hangs, or loses network connectivity.

**Get current config:**

```
GET /queues/:queue/stall-config
```

**Update config:**

```
PUT /queues/:queue/stall-config
```

```json
{

    "gracePeriod": 5000
  }
}
```

| Field           | Default | Description                                                   |
| --------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `stallInterval` | `30000` | A job is stalled after this many ms without a heartbeat       |
| `maxStalls`     | `3`     | Max times a job can stall before moving to DLQ                |
| `gracePeriod`   | `5000`  | Grace period after job starts before stall detection kicks in |

**Broadcasts:** `config:stall-changed` event.

**Get current config:**

```
GET /queues/:queue/dlq-config
```

**Update config:**

```

| ------------ | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `autoRetry`  | `false`     | Automatically retry DLQ entries after a delay                              |
| `maxAge`     | `604800000` | Max age of DLQ entries in ms (default: 7 days). Older entries are removed. |
| `maxEntries` | `10000`     | Max DLQ entries per queue. Oldest are evicted when full.                   |

**Broadcasts:** `config:dlq-changed` event.

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "metrics": {
    "totalPushed": 100000,
    "totalPulled": 99500,
    "totalCompleted": 98000,
    "totalFailed": 200
  }
}
```

---

### Prometheus Metrics

```
GET /prometheus
```

Returns `text/plain; version=0.0.4` format for Prometheus scraping. Includes per-queue gauges, throughput counters, and latency histograms. Optionally requires auth (`requireAuthForMetrics`).

---

### Storage Status

```
GET /storage
```

```json
{ "ok": true, "data": { "diskFull": false, "error": null, "since": null } }
```

In SQLite mode, `diskFull: true` means durable writes are rejected; existing
in-memory work can continue while health remains degraded. In PostgreSQL mode,
`diskFull` is not a local-disk signal: `error` and `since` report database or
projection degradation, affected queue operations can reject, and `/ready`
returns `503` until authority is restored. Memory-only mode has no persistent
storage health to report.

---

### Force Garbage Collection

```
POST /gc
```

Triggers Bun GC and internal memory compaction (`compactMemory()`). Returns before/after heap stats in MB.

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "before": { "heapUsed": 52, "heapTotal": 64, "rss": 90 },
  "after": { "heapUsed": 45, "heapTotal": 64, "rss": 85 }
}
```

---

### Heap Stats

```
GET /heapstats
```

Detailed V8/JSC heap breakdown for debugging memory leaks. Returns top 20 object types by count, internal collection sizes, and heap metrics.

---

## Dashboard Endpoints

Aggregated read-only snapshots designed for dashboards (fewer round-trips than composing the individual endpoints).

### Overview

```
GET /dashboard
```

Single call returning `stats` (global counts + totals + uptime), `throughput` (per-second rates), `latency` (averages + percentiles, nested per operation: `push`, `pull`, `ack`), `memory`, `collections`, `workers` (stats + list, capped at 100 with a `truncated` flag), `crons` (total + list, capped at 100), `storage`, and `timestamp`.

### Queues (paginated)

```
GET /dashboard/queues[?limit=100&offset=0]
```

| Parameter | Type     | Default | Description                  |
| --------- | -------- | ------- | ---------------------------- |
| `limit`   | `number` | `100`   | Max queues to return (1-500) |
| `offset`  | `number` | `0`     | Skip first N queues          |

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "queues": [
    { "name": "emails", "waiting": 125, "delayed": 2, "active": 5, "dlq": 3, "paused": false }
  ],
  "total": 3,
  "limit": 100,
  "offset": 0,
  "timestamp": 1700000000000
}
```

### Queue Detail

```
GET /dashboard/queues/:queue[?includeJobs=true]
```

Returns `counts` (all 8 states, paused-aware), `paused`, `priorityCounts`, a `dlqPreview` (up to 10 entries), and, with `includeJobs=true`, up to 10 job summaries per state (`waiting`, `active`, `delayed`, `paused`).

---

## Real-time Events

bunqueue provides two real-time event channels: **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** for simple one-way streaming, and **WebSocket** with full pub/sub for interactive dashboards.

### Server-Sent Events (SSE)

```
GET /events
GET /events/queues/:queue
```

SSE sends typed events. Each job event has an `id:` (used for `Last-Event-ID` resume), an `event:` name identical to the WebSocket pub/sub names (`job:completed`, `job:failed`, ...), and a JSON `data:` payload `{ queue, jobId, timestamp, error?, progress?, prev?, delay? }`. Dashboard and periodic events (`queue:counts`, `queue:paused`, `stats:snapshot` every 5s, `health:status` every 10s, `storage:status` every 30s, ...) use the same stream with their pub/sub payloads; `/events/queues/:queue` filters only job events. The first message is an unnamed `{ "connected": true, "clientId": "..." }`, and a `:heartbeat` comment is sent every 30 seconds. Because events are named, listen with `addEventListener`; `onmessage` only receives the unnamed connection message. For authenticated SSE, use `@microsoft/fetch-event-source` (native `EventSource` doesn't support custom headers).

```javascript
const events = new EventSource('http://localhost:6790/events');
for (const name of ['job:completed', 'job:failed']) {
  events.addEventListener(name, (e) => {
    const data = JSON.parse(e.data);
    console.log(`[${e.type}] ${data.queue} ${data.jobId}`);
  });
}
```

### WebSocket Pub/Sub

```
ws://localhost:6790/ws
ws://localhost:6790/ws/queues/:queue
```

WebSocket supports **86 explicit event names** across 19 namespaces, plus namespace and global wildcards. Clients subscribe to specific events and receive only matching data, **zero polling needed**.

#### Event Format

Every pub/sub event follows this structure:

```json
{
  "event": "job:completed",
  "ts": 1710000000000,
  "data": {
    "queue": "payments",
    "jobId": "abc-123"
  }
}
```

- `event`, event name (category:action)
- `ts`, unix timestamp in milliseconds
- `data`, event-specific payload

#### Subscribe / Unsubscribe

After connecting, send a `Subscribe` command to start receiving events:

```json
{
  "cmd": "Subscribe",
  "events": ["job:*", "queue:counts", "stats:snapshot", "health:status"],
  "reqId": "1"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "subscribed": ["job:*", "queue:counts", "stats:snapshot", "health:status"],
  "reqId": "1"
}
```

**Unsubscribe from specific events:**

```json
{ "cmd": "Unsubscribe", "events": ["job:progress"] }
```

**Unsubscribe from everything:**

```json
{ "cmd": "Unsubscribe", "events": [] }
```

#### Wildcards

| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `*`             | Every emitted event                                                      |

| `ratelimit:*`   | All 4 rate-limit events                                                  |

| `auth:*`        | `auth:failed`                                                            |
| `cleanup:*`     | Both cleanup events                                                      |

`job:*` and `*` may also receive `job:waiting` and `job:duplicated` from the
legacy job-event bridge. They are compatibility emission names, not entries in
the explicit subscription allow-list, so subscribing to either exact name is
currently rejected. Use `job:deduplicated` for an exact deduplication
subscription.

#### Legacy Mode

Clients that never send `Subscribe` receive all job events in the **old format** (`{ eventType: "completed", queue, jobId, ... }`). This maintains backward compatibility with existing integrations.

#### Sending Commands

WebSocket clients can also send any TCP protocol command as JSON. This allows a dashboard to both receive events AND send commands (pause queue, retry job, etc.) over a single connection:

```javascript
// Send a command
ws.send(JSON.stringify({ cmd: 'Pause', queue: 'emails', reqId: '2' }));

// Response
{ "ok": true, "reqId": "2" }
```

#### Authentication

When `AUTH_TOKENS` is configured, the upgrade request must carry `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. A handshake without a valid token is rejected with `401` before the socket opens, so sending `{ "cmd": "Auth", "token": "..." }` after connecting cannot replace header auth. The browser's native `WebSocket` API cannot set this header.

#### Connection Cleanup

When a WebSocket disconnects, all jobs owned by that client (pulled but not ACKed) are automatically released back to the queue. This prevents jobs from being stuck when a worker disconnects unexpectedly.

#### Complete Dashboard Example

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:6790/ws');

ws.onopen = () => {
  // Subscribe to everything a dashboard needs
  ws.send(
    JSON.stringify({
      cmd: 'Subscribe',
      events: [
        'job:*', // All job lifecycle events
        'queue:counts', // Real-time count updates (eliminates N+1 polling)
        'stats:snapshot', // Global stats every 5s
        'health:status', // Health check every 10s
        'worker:*', // Worker connect/disconnect
        'dlq:*', // DLQ events
        'cron:*', // Cron events
        'queue:paused', // Queue state changes
        'queue:resumed',
      ],
    })
  );
};

ws.onmessage = (e) => {
  const msg = JSON.parse(e.data);

  // Pub/sub event
  if (msg.event) {
    switch (msg.event) {
      // Periodic snapshots (replace HTTP polling)
      case 'stats:snapshot':
        updateOverviewCards(msg.data);
        updateMetricsCharts(msg.data);
        break;
      case 'health:status':
        updateConnectionBanner(msg.data.ok);
        updateMemoryDisplay(msg.data.memory);
        break;

      // Queue counts (eliminates the N+1 problem)
      case 'queue:counts':
        updateQueueRow(msg.data.queue, msg.data);
        break;

      // Real-time activity feed
      case 'job:completed':
      case 'job:failed':
      case 'job:pushed':
        addToActivityFeed(msg);
        break;

      // Worker status
      case 'worker:connected':
        addWorkerRow(msg.data);
        break;
      case 'worker:disconnected':
        removeWorkerRow(msg.data.workerId);
        break;

      // DLQ alerts
      case 'dlq:added':
        incrementDlqCounter(msg.data.queue);
        showAlert(`Job ${msg.data.jobId} moved to DLQ: ${msg.data.reason}`);
        break;
    }
    return;
  }

  // Command response (for interactive operations)
  if (msg.reqId) {
    handleCommandResponse(msg);
  }
};

// Interactive: pause a queue from the dashboard
function pauseQueue(queue) {
  ws.send(JSON.stringify({ cmd: 'Pause', queue, reqId: `pause-${queue}` }));
}
```

### Explicit Subscription Events (86)

The following names can be supplied directly in a WebSocket `Subscribe`
command. Payload fields listed with `?` are present only on the path that has
that information; the outer event envelope always supplies `event`, `ts`, and
`data`.

#### Job Lifecycle (21 events)

| Event                       | Payload                              | Description                                |

### The `queue:counts` Event

This is the most impactful event for dashboards. Job lifecycle activity schedules a refresh for the affected queue; refreshes within a 10ms window are coalesced, and the emitted payload contains the latest counts:

```json
{
  "event": "queue:counts",
  "ts": 1710000000000,
  "data": {
    "queue": "payments",
    "waiting": 15,
    "prioritized": 4,
    "active": 2,
    "completed": 100,
    "failed": 0,
    "delayed": 3
  }
}
```

**Without `queue:counts`:** A dashboard with 20 queues needs to poll `GET /queues/:q/counts` for each queue every few seconds = 200+ HTTP requests per minute.

**With `queue:counts`:** Subscribe once, receive real-time updates only when counts change. Zero polling, instant UI updates.
