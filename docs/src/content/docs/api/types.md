  <h1 class="bq-hero-h1 bq-bench-h1">Every TypeScript type, <em>spelled out.</em></h1>
  <p class="bq-hero-sub">bunqueue is written in TypeScript and provides comprehensive type definitions. Exported types are imported from <code>bunqueue/client</code>; some shapes below (for example <code>JobStateType</code>, <code>JobCounts</code>, <code>RepeatOptions</code>, and <code>AttemptRecord</code>) are documented for reference but not exported.</p>
</div>

## Job Types

### JobStateType

```typescript
type JobStateType =
  | 'waiting' // In queue, priority = 0
  | 'prioritized' // In queue, priority > 0 (BullMQ v5)
  | 'delayed' // Waiting for delay to expire
  | 'active' // Currently being processed
  | 'completed' // Successfully finished
  | 'failed' // Failed after all retries (DLQ)
  | 'waiting-children' // Waiting for child jobs to complete (flows)
  | 'unknown'; // Job not found or invalid state
```

:::note[BullMQ v5 State Machine]
bunqueue implements the full BullMQ v5 job state machine:

**Key differences from BullMQ v5:**

- `failed` = BullMQ's failed state. Internally stored in DLQ with metadata (reason, attempt history).
- `prioritized` = BullMQ's prioritized state. Jobs with `priority > 0` are in a separate logical state but share the same priority queue data structure.
- `waiting-children` = Parent jobs waiting for child flows to complete before becoming processable.

}
```

### JobOptions

Options when adding a job to a queue.

```typescript
interface JobOptions {
  /** Ungrouped job priority (higher = processed sooner, default: 0) */
  priority?: number;

  /** Delay in milliseconds before job becomes available (default: 0) */
  delay?: number;

  /** Maximum number of processing attempts (default: 3) */
  attempts?: number;

  /**
   * Backoff between retries. Either a delay in ms or a BackoffOptions object.
   * Default: 1000
   */
  backoff?: number | BackoffOptions;

  /** Processing timeout in milliseconds. Job fails if exceeded. */
  timeout?: number;

  /**
   * Custom job ID for idempotent/deduplication.
   * If a job with this ID already exists, the existing job is returned.
   */
  jobId?: string;

  /**
   * Remove job on completion. Boolean only: age/count retention
   * (number | KeepJobs) is not implemented and would be silently
   * ignored, so the type is narrowed to prevent the misuse.
   * Default: false
   */
  removeOnComplete?: boolean;

  /** Remove job on failure. Boolean only, see removeOnComplete. Default: false */
  removeOnFail?: boolean;

  /** Stall timeout in ms. Job is stalled if no heartbeat after this time. */
  stallTimeout?: number;

  /** Repeat configuration for recurring jobs */
  repeat?: RepeatOptions;

  /**
   * Request immediate admission persistence.
   * SQLite bypasses its write buffer; PostgreSQL admissions are already transactional.
   * Default: false (uses the SQLite buffer when that backend is selected)
   */
  durable?: boolean;

  /**
   * Parent job reference for flow dependencies.
   * When set, this job becomes a child of the specified parent.
   * The parent will wait for all children to complete before processing.
   */
  parent?: ParentOpts;

  /** Process jobs in LIFO order (newest first, default: false) */
  lifo?: boolean;

  /** Maximum stack trace lines to store on failure (default: 10) */
  stackTraceLimit?: number;

  /** Maximum number of log entries to keep per job */
  keepLogs?: number;

  /** Maximum job data size in bytes. Jobs exceeding this are rejected. */
  sizeLimit?: number;

  /** Fail parent job if this child job fails (default: false) */
  failParentOnFailure?: boolean;

  /** Remove dependency relationship if this job fails (default: false) */
  removeDependencyOnFailure?: boolean;

  /** Continue parent processing even if this child fails (default: false) */
  continueParentOnFailure?: boolean;

  /** Move job to parent's failed dependencies instead of blocking parent (default: false) */
  ignoreDependencyOnFailure?: boolean;

  /** Job creation timestamp in ms (default: Date.now()) */
  timestamp?: number;

  /** Deduplication configuration */
  deduplication?: DeduplicationOptions;

  /** Debounce configuration */
  debounce?: DebounceOptions;

  /** Round-robin/FIFO job group membership */
  group?: GroupJobOptions;
}
```

### GroupJobOptions

```typescript
interface GroupJobOptions {
  /** Non-empty group identifier; safe integers are normalized to strings */
  id: string | number;

  /** Maximum pending jobs admitted atomically for this group */
  maxSize?: number;

  /** Integer from 0 to 2,097,151; lower values run first */
  priority?: number;
}
```

### ParentOpts

```typescript
interface ParentOpts {
  /** Parent job ID */
  id: string;
  /** Parent job queue name */
  queue: string;
}
```

### BackoffOptions

```typescript
interface BackoffOptions {
  /** Backoff strategy type */
  type: 'fixed' | 'exponential';
  /** Base delay in milliseconds (0 to 86,400,000) */
  delay: number;
  /** Upper bound for one retry delay in milliseconds (0 to 86,400,000). Default: 1 hour */
  maxDelay?: number;
}
```

All backoff delays include automatic **jitter** to prevent thundering herd:

- **Exponential**: ±50% jitter around the computed delay
- **Fixed**: ±20% jitter around the configured delay

Each retry delay is capped at `maxDelay`, or at 1 hour when `maxDelay` is not set. This prevents runaway delays at high attempt counts. `maxDelay: 0` retries immediately.

```typescript
// Exponential growth, but never wait more than 30 seconds between attempts
await queue.add('sync', data, {
  attempts: 10,
  backoff: { type: 'exponential', delay: 1000, maxDelay: 30_000 },
});
```

The server rejects a `maxDelay` that is not a finite number between 0 and 86,400,000 (24 hours) on `PUSH`, `PUSHB`, HTTP push and atomic flows; atomic flows also reject it in embedded mode. Embedded `Queue.add` and `addBulk`, and scheduler job templates, ignore an invalid `maxDelay` and keep the 1-hour default. `Queue.getJob`, `Queue.getJobs`, `FlowProducer` results, embedded `add()` and the jobs a `Worker` receives (embedded and TCP) return `maxDelay` in `job.opts.backoff` when it was set. A job added with a numeric `backoff` keeps the number in `job.opts.backoff`. The server applies the cap itself when it schedules a retry.

A processor that throws `DelayedError` postpones the job by its base backoff (`backoff`, or `backoff.delay` for the object form) without growth or jitter, falling back to 1000 ms when the base is 0 or negative, and capped at `maxDelay` (1 hour by default). The wait is never zero: `maxDelay: 0` only makes failed attempts retry immediately, so a `DelayedError` job with `maxDelay: 0` waits its base backoff, capped at 1 hour. See [Postpone a job with DelayedError](/guide/worker/errors/#postpone-a-job-with-delayederror).

### KeepJobs

Defined for BullMQ compatibility but not re-exported from `bunqueue/client`. Not accepted by per-job `removeOnComplete`/`removeOnFail` (those are boolean only); the equivalent shape is accepted by `WorkerOptions.removeOnComplete`/`removeOnFail`.

```typescript
interface KeepJobs {
  /** Maximum age in milliseconds */
  age?: number;
  /** Maximum count of jobs to keep */
  count?: number;
}
```

### RepeatOptions

Configuration for recurring/repeatable jobs.

```typescript
interface RepeatOptions {
  /** Repeat every N milliseconds (alternative to pattern) */
  every?: number;

  /** Maximum repetitions (omit or null for infinite) */
  limit?: number;

  /** Cron pattern (alternative to every) */
  pattern?: string;

  /** Start date for repeat jobs */
  startDate?: Date | string | number;

  /** End date for repeat jobs */
  endDate?: Date | string | number;

  /** Timezone for cron pattern (e.g. 'America/New_York') */
  tz?: string;

  /** Execute immediately on start (default: false) */
  immediately?: boolean;

  /** Current repeat count (internal) */
  count?: number;

  /** Previous execution timestamp (internal) */
  prevMillis?: number;

  /** Offset in milliseconds */
  offset?: number;

  /** Custom job ID for repeat jobs */
  jobId?: string;
}
```

### DeduplicationOptions

Prevent duplicate jobs from being added to the queue.

```typescript
interface DeduplicationOptions {
  /** Unique deduplication ID (required) */
  id: string;

  /** TTL in milliseconds for the deduplication key */
  ttl?: number;

  /** Extend TTL when a duplicate job arrives (for debounce mode) */
  extend?: boolean;

  /** Replace job data when duplicate arrives while in delayed state */
  replace?: boolean;
}
```

### DebounceOptions

Debounce job creation within a time window.

```typescript
interface DebounceOptions {
  /** Unique debounce ID (required) */
  id: string;

  /** TTL in milliseconds for the debounce window (required) */
  ttl: number;
}
```

### Processor

```typescript
interface ProcessorContext {
  signal: AbortSignal;
}

interface ObservableLike<T> {
  subscribe(observer: {
    next(value: T): void;
    error(error: unknown): void;
    complete(): void;
  }): { unsubscribe(): void } | (() => void) | undefined;
}

type Processor<T = unknown, R = unknown> = (
  job: Job<T & FlowJobData>,
  context?: ProcessorContext
) => Promise<R> | ObservableLike<R> | R;
```

The Worker supplies a fresh `AbortSignal` for every delivery. A processing
timeout, `worker.cancelJob()`, or `worker.cancelAllJobs()` aborts it. Promise
processors are cooperative and must pass the signal to cancellable work or
check `signal.aborted`; an ignored signal does not forcibly stop JavaScript.
A structural Observable needs no RxJS dependency: its final `next` value is the
job result, `error` fails the attempt, completion without a value fails, and
abort unsubscribes it.

`FlowJobData` contains the optional flow-injected fields (`__parentId`,
`__parentQueue`, `__childrenIds`, `__flowParentId`, `__flowParentIds`) that
FlowProducer adds to broker-backed `job.data` when a job is part of a flow.
They are engine-owned: flow creation rejects caller `__*` keys, and
`updateData()` preserves the existing values rather than allowing them to be
removed or replaced.

### JobCounts

Returned by `queue.getJobCounts()`.

```typescript
interface JobCounts {
  waiting: number;
  prioritized: number;
  active: number;
  completed: number;
  failed: number;
  delayed: number;
  paused: number;
  'waiting-children': number;
}
```

## Queue Types

### QueueOptions

```typescript
interface QueueOptions {
  /** Default job options applied to all jobs in this queue */
  defaultJobOptions?: JobOptions;

  /** TCP connection options (for server mode) */
  connection?: ConnectionOptions;

  /** Use embedded mode (in-process memory or SQLite, default: false) */
  embedded?: boolean;

  /**
   * SQLite path for embedded mode. A later explicit path must match the
   * process-wide manager's active database or construction throws.
   */
  dataPath?: string;

  /**
   * Auto-batching for queue.add() calls in TCP mode.
   * Buffers concurrent add() calls and sends them as a single PUSHB command.
   * Default: enabled for TCP mode, disabled for embedded mode.
   */
  autoBatch?: AutoBatchOptions;

  /**
   * Namespace prefix prepended to the queue name on the server.
   * Lets multiple environments (e.g. `dev:`, `prod:`) or tenants share
   * the same broker without their jobs, workers, cron schedulers, stats,
   * pause state, DLQ, or rate limits overlapping. `Queue.name` keeps
   * returning the logical name; only the server-side key is prefixed.
   * See the [Namespace Isolation](/guide/queue/advanced/#namespace-isolation-prefixkey)
   * guide.
   */
  prefixKey?: string;
}
```

### AutoBatchOptions

```typescript
interface AutoBatchOptions {
  /** Enable auto-batching (default: true for TCP, false for embedded) */
  enabled?: boolean;
  /** Max items before auto-flush (default: 50) */
  maxSize?: number;
  /** Max delay in ms before auto-flush (default: 5) */
  maxDelayMs?: number;
}
```

Jobs added with `durable: true` bypass the batcher and are sent as individual PUSH commands.

### ConnectionOptions

```typescript
interface ConnectionOptions {
  /** Server hostname (default: 'localhost') */
  host?: string;

  /** TCP port (default: 6789) */
  port?: number;

  /** Declared but not read by the client: connections always use host/port */
  socketPath?: string;

  /** Enable TLS to the server: true (system CAs) or custom options (default: off) */
  tls?: boolean | ClientTlsOptions;

  /** Authentication token */
  token?: string;

  /**
   * Connection pool size for parallel operations.
   * Default: 4 for Queue/FlowProducer; Worker defaults to min(concurrency, 8).
   */
  poolSize?: number;

  /** Ping interval in ms for health checks (default: 30000, 0 to disable) */
  pingInterval?: number;

  /** Command timeout in ms (default: 30000) */
  commandTimeout?: number;

  /**
   * Consecutive command timeouts (no intervening success) before the connection
   * is concluded dead and a reconnect is forced (default: 3, 0 to disable).
   * Recovery path for a half-open socket, independent of the health-check ping.
   */
  maxCommandTimeouts?: number;

  /** Enable TCP pipelining (default: true) */
  pipelining?: boolean;

  /** Max commands in flight per connection (default: 100) */
  maxInFlight?: number;
}
```

### ClientTlsOptions

```typescript
interface ClientTlsOptions {
  /** Verify the server certificate (default: true). Set false for self-signed in dev. */
  rejectUnauthorized?: boolean;
  /** Path to a PEM CA certificate to trust (e.g. the self-signed server cert) */
  caFile?: string;
}
```

### RateLimiterOptions

```typescript
interface RateLimiterOptions {
  /** Maximum number of jobs to process in the duration window */
  max: number;

  /** Duration window in milliseconds */
  duration: number;

  /** Optional group key for per-group rate limiting */
  groupKey?: string;
}
```

## Worker Types

### WorkerOptions

```typescript
interface WorkerOptions {
  /** Number of concurrent jobs (default: 1) */
  concurrency?: number;

  /** Auto-run on creation (default: true) */
  autorun?: boolean;

  /** Heartbeat interval in ms (default: 10000, 0 to disable) */
  heartbeatInterval?: number;

  /** TCP connection options (for server mode) */
  connection?: ConnectionOptions;

  /** Use embedded mode (in-process memory or SQLite, default: false) */
  embedded?: boolean;

  /**
   * SQLite path for embedded mode. A later explicit path must match the

  dataPath?: string;

  /** Number of jobs to pull per batch (default: 10, max: 1000) */

  pollTimeout?: number;

  /**
   * Use lock-based job ownership.
   * When enabled, each pulled job gets a lock renewed via heartbeat.
   * Disable for high-throughput scenarios where stall detection is sufficient.
   * Default: true
   */

   * different prefixes never see each other's jobs. See the
   * [Namespace Isolation](/guide/queue/advanced/#namespace-isolation-prefixkey) guide.
   */
  prefixKey?: string;
}
```

### GroupWorkerOptions

```typescript
interface GroupWorkerOptions {
  /** Maximum active jobs per group; omitted means unlimited */
  concurrency?: number;

  /** Fixed-window starts allowed independently for every group */
  limit?: { max: number; duration: number };
}
```

### BatchWorkerOptions

```typescript
interface BatchWorkerOptions {
  /** Maximum jobs in one processor invocation (1..1000) */
  size: number;

  /** Minimum members before starting (default: 1; must be <= size) */
  minSize?: number;

  /** Maximum wait for minSize in ms; omitted/0 waits indefinitely */
  timeout?: number;

  /** Keep every member in a batch on the same group ID (default: false) */
  groupAffinity?: boolean;
}
```

With `batch`, `concurrency` counts concurrent processor invocations, while each
invocation may own up to `batch.size` independently leased jobs. The processor
is called once with a leading job; `job.getBatch()` returns all members and
`member.setAsFailed(error)` selectively fails one. Without `groupAffinity`, a
batch that contains grouped work does not wait for `minSize`. With affinity,
the broker and Worker keep one group ID per batch and the minimum-size wait is
honored.

### Worker Pro control methods

```typescript
worker.cancelJob(jobId: string, reason?: string): boolean;
worker.cancelAllJobs(reason?: string): void;
worker.isJobCancelled(jobId: string): boolean;
worker.rateLimitGroup(job: Job, duration: number): Promise<void>;
```

Cancellation targets only deliveries active in that Worker and aborts their
processor signals. `rateLimitGroup` requires a grouped active job, installs a
broker-authoritative manual deadline, and moves that delivery back to waiting.
It does not require `WorkerOptions.group.limit`.

### Worker Events

```typescript
// Worker emits these events:
worker.on('ready', () => void);
worker.on('active', (job: Job) => void);
worker.on('completed', (job: Job, result: R) => void);
worker.on('failed', (job: Job, error: Error) => void);
worker.on('progress', (job: Job | null, progress: number) => void);
worker.on('stalled', (jobId: string, reason: string) => void);
worker.on('cancelled', (data: { jobId: string; reason: string }) => void);
worker.on('log', (job: Job, message: string) => void);
worker.on('error', (error: Error) => void);
worker.on('drained', () => void);
worker.on('closed', () => void);
```

## QueueEvents Types

### QueueEvents

Event listener class for monitoring queue activity without processing jobs.

```typescript
class QueueEvents<R = unknown, P = unknown> extends EventEmitter {
  /** Queue name being monitored */
  readonly name: string;

  constructor(name: string, options?: QueueEventsOptions);

  /** Wait until the QueueEvents instance is ready to receive events */
  waitUntilReady(): Promise<void>;

  /** Close the event listener and stop receiving events */
  close(): void;

  /** Disconnect from the event stream (alias for close) */
  disconnect(): Promise<void>;
}

interface QueueEventsOptions {
  embedded?: boolean;
  connection?: ConnectionOptions;
  /** Must match the process-wide embedded manager when one is already active. */
  dataPath?: string;
  prefixKey?: string;
}
```

Calling `new QueueEvents(name)` keeps the historical embedded default. Pass
`{ connection }` or `{ embedded: false, connection }` to subscribe to a remote
broker. The TCP subscription uses a dedicated authenticated connection and
automatically re-subscribes after reconnect.

## BullMQ Pro aliases

```typescript
import { QueuePro, WorkerPro, QueueEventsPro } from 'bunqueue/client';
import type { JobPro } from 'bunqueue/client';
```

`QueuePro`, `WorkerPro`, and `QueueEventsPro` are aliases of the native
`Queue`, `Worker`, and `QueueEvents` implementations; `JobPro<T>` aliases
`Job<T>`. They add no wrapper state, connection, persistence path, or telemetry.
The aliases make Pro-oriented migrations explicit while retaining the ordinary
class names and behavior.

### QueueEvents Event Payloads

Each event emitted by `QueueEvents` has a typed payload:

```typescript
/** Emitted when a job is added to the queue */
interface WaitingEvent {
  jobId: string;
}

/** Emitted when a job begins processing */
interface ActiveEvent {
  jobId: string;
}

/** Emitted when a job completes successfully */
interface CompletedEvent<R = unknown> {
  jobId: string;
  returnvalue: R;
}

/** Emitted when a job fails */
interface FailedEvent {
  jobId: string;
  failedReason: string;
  data?: unknown;
  terminal?: boolean; // false while a retry is pending; true once the job failed for good
}

/** Emitted when job progress is updated */
interface ProgressEvent<P = unknown> {
  jobId: string;
  data: P;
}

/** Emitted when a job stalls (no heartbeat) */
interface StalledEvent {
  jobId: string;
}

/** Emitted when a job is removed from the queue */
interface RemovedEvent {
  jobId: string;
  prev: string;
}

/** Emitted when a job is moved to delayed state */
interface DelayedEvent {
  jobId: string;
  delay: number;
}

/** Emitted when a duplicate job is detected */
interface DuplicatedEvent {
  jobId: string;
}

/** Emitted when a job is retried */
interface RetriedEvent {
  jobId: string;
  prev: string;
}

/** Emitted when a job enters waiting-children state */
interface WaitingChildrenEvent {
  jobId: string;
}

/** Emitted when the queue has no more waiting jobs */
interface DrainedEvent {
  id: string;
}
```

### QueueEvents Usage

```typescript
const events = new QueueEvents('my-queue', {
  connection: { host: '127.0.0.1', port: 6789, token: process.env.BUNQUEUE_TOKEN },
});

events.on('waiting', ({ jobId }) => {
  /* ... */
});
events.on('active', ({ jobId }) => {
  /* ... */
});
events.on('completed', ({ jobId, returnvalue }) => {
  /* ... */
});
events.on('failed', ({ jobId, failedReason }) => {
  /* ... */
});
events.on('progress', ({ jobId, data }) => {
  /* ... */
});
events.on('stalled', ({ jobId }) => {
  /* ... */
});
events.on('removed', ({ jobId, prev }) => {
  /* ... */
});
events.on('delayed', ({ jobId, delay }) => {
  /* ... */
});
events.on('duplicated', ({ jobId }) => {
  /* ... */
});
events.on('retried', ({ jobId, prev }) => {
  /* ... */
});
events.on('waiting-children', ({ jobId }) => {
  /* ... */
});
events.on('drained', ({ id }) => {
  /* ... */
});
events.on('paused', () => {
  /* ... */
});
events.on('resumed', () => {
  /* ... */
});
events.on('error', (error: Error) => {
  /* ... */
});
```

## QueueEventType

```typescript
type QueueEventType =
  'waiting' | 'active' | 'completed' | 'failed' | 'progress' | 'removed' | 'drained';
```

## FlowProducer Types

### FlowProducerOptions

```typescript
interface FlowProducerOptions {
  /** Use embedded mode (no server) */
  embedded?: boolean;
  /** TCP connection options */
  connection?: ConnectionOptions;
}
```

:::note
FlowProducer extends `EventEmitter` (BullMQ v5 compatible). You can listen for
events using `.on()`, `.once()`, etc. The `close()` method returns
`Promise<void>`. `closing` is `null` while live and becomes that one stable
Promise when `close()` or `disconnect()` first starts shutdown.
:::

Result helpers are transport-aware:

```typescript
getParentResult<R>(id: string): R | undefined | Promise<R | undefined>;
getParentResults<R>(ids: string[]): Map<string, R> | Promise<Map<string, R>>;
```

Always `await` them in portable code. Embedded mode preserves its synchronous
return; TCP mode performs broker `GetResult` calls. Missing is `undefined`,
whereas a persisted `null` is retained as a real completed result.

### FlowOpts

Per-flow options passed as the second argument to `flow.add(flowJob, opts)`.

```typescript
interface FlowOpts {
  /**
   * Default job options per queue name.
   * Applied as defaults; per-job opts override these.
   * jobId is intentionally excluded because identity belongs to each flow node.
   */
  queuesOptions?: Record<string, Omit<Partial<JobOptions>, 'jobId'>>;
}
```

Set `jobId` on a `FlowJob.opts` object when a node needs a custom identity.
`jobId` is rejected inside `queuesOptions`: a shared default could assign the
same identity to multiple nodes and make the atomic graph ambiguous. Python
follows the same rule using `job_id` inside each node's `opts`, never inside
`queues_options`.

**Example:**

```typescript
await flow.add(
  {
    name: 'parent',
    queueName: 'reports',
    children: [
      { name: 'fetch', queueName: 'api', data: { url: '...' } },
      { name: 'parse', queueName: 'cpu', data: {} },
    ],
  },
  {
    queuesOptions: {
      api: { attempts: 5, backoff: 2000 }, // All jobs in 'api' queue
      cpu: { timeout: 60000 }, // All jobs in 'cpu' queue
    },
  }
);
```

### FlowJob

A job definition within a flow. Children are processed before the parent.

```typescript
interface FlowJob<T = unknown> {
  /** Job name */
  name: string;
  /** Queue name */
  queueName: string;
  /** Job data */
  data?: T;
  /** Job options */
  opts?: JobOptions;
  /** Child jobs (processed BEFORE this job) */
  children?: FlowJob<T>[];
}
```

### JobNode

Result from adding a flow. Contains the created job and its children.

```typescript
interface JobNode<T = unknown> {
  /** The created job instance */
  job: Job<T>;
  /** Child nodes (if any) */
  children?: JobNode<T>[];
}
```

### GetFlowOpts

```typescript
interface GetFlowOpts {
  /** Job ID to get the flow for */
  id: string;
  /** Queue name where the job is located */
  queueName: string;
  /** Maximum depth to traverse (default: unlimited) */
  depth?: number;
  /** Maximum number of children to fetch per level (default: unlimited) */
  maxChildren?: number;
}
```

## SandboxedWorker Types

### SandboxedWorkerOptions

```typescript
interface SandboxedWorkerOptions {
  /** Path to processor file (must export default async function) */
  processor: string;

  /** Number of worker processes (default: 1) */
  concurrency?: number;

  /** Job timeout in ms (default: 30000, 0 = disabled) */
  timeout?: number;

  /** Max memory per worker in MB (default: 256, uses smol mode if <= 64) */
  maxMemory?: number;

  /** Max restarts before giving up (default: 10) */
  maxRestarts?: number;

  /** Auto-restart crashed workers (default: true) */
  autoRestart?: boolean;

  /** Poll interval in ms when no workers are idle (default: 10) */
  pollInterval?: number;

  /** Job heartbeat interval in ms (default: 10000 for TCP, 5000 for embedded; 0 disables) */
  heartbeatInterval?: number;

  /** TCP connection options (omit for embedded mode) */
  connection?: ConnectionOptions;

  /** Auto-stop after this many ms of inactivity (0 = disabled, default: 0) */
  idleTimeout?: number;

  /** Recycle individual idle worker processes after this many ms (default: 30000, 0 = disabled) */
  idleRecycleMs?: number;

  /** Auto-restart the worker pool when new jobs arrive after idle shutdown (default: false) */
  autoStart?: boolean;

  /** Poll interval in ms for checking new jobs while in idle-shutdown state (default: 5000) */
  autoStartPollMs?: number;
}
```

### SandboxedWorker Stats

Returned by `sandboxedWorker.getStats()`.

```typescript
{
  total: number; // Total worker processes
  busy: number; // Currently processing
  idle: number; // Alive and available for work
  recycled: number; // Workers recycled after idling
  restarts: number; // Total restarts across all workers
}
```

## Stall Detection Types

### StallConfig

```typescript
interface StallConfig {
  /** Enable stall detection (default: true) */
  enabled?: boolean;

  /** Stall timeout in ms (default: 30000) */
  stallInterval?: number;

  /** Max stalls before moving to DLQ (default: 3) */
  maxStalls?: number;

  /** Grace period after job start in ms (default: 5000) */
  gracePeriod?: number;
}
```

## DLQ Types

### DlqConfig

```typescript
interface DlqConfig {
  /** Enable auto-retry from DLQ (default: false) */
  autoRetry?: boolean;

  /** Auto-retry interval in ms (default: 3600000 = 1 hour) */
  autoRetryInterval?: number;

  /** Max auto-retries before giving up (default: 3) */
  maxAutoRetries?: number;

  /** Max age before auto-purge in ms (default: 604800000 = 7 days, null = never) */
  maxAge?: number | null;

  /** Max entries per queue (default: 10000) */
  maxEntries?: number;
}
```

### FailureReason

```typescript
type FailureReason =
  | 'explicit_fail' // Job explicitly failed via fail() or thrown error
  | 'max_attempts_exceeded' // Exceeded all retry attempts
  | 'timeout' // Job processing timed out (exceeded timeout option)
  | 'stalled' // Job stalled (no heartbeat within stallInterval)
  | 'ttl_expired' // Time-to-live expired before processing
  | 'worker_lost' // Worker disconnected while processing (TCP mode)
  | 'unknown'; // Catch-all for edge cases
```

:::note[When is 'unknown' used?]
The `unknown` reason is a catch-all for rare edge cases:

- Job data corruption during serialization
- Internal queue manager errors
- Jobs recovered from database without failure metadata
- Race conditions during shutdown

If you see many `unknown` failures, check logs for underlying errors.
:::

### DlqEntry

```typescript
interface DlqEntry<T = unknown> {
  /** The failed job */
  job: Job<T>;

  /** When job entered DLQ (ms since epoch) */
  enteredAt: number;

  /** Last failure reason */
  reason: FailureReason;

  /** Last error message */
  error: string | null;

  /** Full attempt history */
  attempts: Array<AttemptRecord>;

  /** Number of retry attempts from DLQ */
  retryCount: number;

  /** Last retry timestamp */
  lastRetryAt: number | null;

  /** Next scheduled auto-retry (null = no auto-retry) */
  nextRetryAt: number | null;

  /** When entry expires for auto-purge (null = never) */
  expiresAt: number | null;
}
```

### AttemptRecord

```typescript
interface AttemptRecord {
  /** Attempt number (1-based) */
  attempt: number;

  /** When this attempt started (ms since epoch) */
  startedAt: number;

  /** When this attempt failed (ms since epoch) */
  failedAt: number;

  /** Failure reason for this attempt */
  reason: FailureReason;

  /** Error message if any */
  error: string | null;

  /** Duration of this attempt in ms */
  duration: number;
}
```

### DlqFilter

  newerThan?: number;

  /** Only entries that can be retried */
  retriable?: boolean;

  /** Only entries that are expired */
  expired?: boolean;

  /** Limit number of results */
  limit?: number;

  /** Offset for pagination */
  offset?: number;
}
```

### DlqStats

```typescript
interface DlqStats {
  /** Total DLQ entries */
  total: number;

  /** Entries grouped by failure reason */
  byReason: Record<FailureReason, number>;

  /** Entries grouped by queue name */
  byQueue: Record<string, number>;

}
```

## Generic Type Helpers

bunqueue supports generic types for type-safe job data and results:

```typescript
// Define typed job data
interface EmailJobData {
  to: string;
  subject: string;
  body: string;
}

interface EmailResult {
  sent: boolean;
  messageId: string;
}

// Queue with typed data
const queue = new Queue<EmailJobData>('emails');

// TypeScript enforces the data shape
await queue.add('welcome', {
  to: 'user@example.com',
  subject: 'Welcome!',
  body: 'Hello and welcome.',
});

// Worker with typed data and result
const worker = new Worker<EmailJobData, EmailResult>('emails', async (job) => {
  // job.data is typed as EmailJobData
  const { to, subject, body } = job.data;
  return { sent: true, messageId: 'msg-123' };
});

// Type error at compile time: missing required fields
await queue.add('send', { to: 'test@example.com' }); // Error!

// QueueEvents with typed result and progress
const events = new QueueEvents<EmailResult, number>('emails');
events.on('completed', ({ jobId, returnvalue }) => {
  // returnvalue is typed as EmailResult
  console.log(returnvalue.messageId);
});
```
