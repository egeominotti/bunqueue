# Webhooks, Events & Job Logs

> **Category:** Observability · **Source:** `src/application/webhookManager.ts`, `src/domain/types/webhook.ts`, `src/application/eventsManager.ts`, `src/application/jobLogsManager.ts`, `src/application/clientTracking.ts`, `src/application/clientOwnership.ts`, `src/infrastructure/server/tcp/connections.ts`, `src/client/events.ts`

## Purpose

This module provides the server's outbound and inbound observability surfaces for job activity. `WebhookManager` delivers HTTP callbacks (with optional HMAC signing and SSRF protection) when job lifecycle events occur; `EventsManager` is the in-process pub/sub hub that fans events out to local subscribers (SSE, dashboard, `WaitJob`) and feeds the webhook layer; `jobLogsManager` stores bounded per-job log lines; and `clientOwnership`/`clientTracking` own the client→job ownership map (one owner per delivery) that releases in-flight jobs back to their queues when a TCP/SSE connection drops. Together they answer "what happened to my jobs" without coupling the core queue engine to any transport.

## Responsibilities & Scope

Owns:

- Webhook registry (in-memory `Map<WebhookId, Webhook>`), URL validation, delivery with retries, HMAC-SHA256 signing, and per-webhook success/failure counters (`webhookManager.ts:32`).
- The canonical webhook event vocabulary and event→webhook mapping (`webhook.ts:16`, `eventsManager.ts:185`).
- In-process scalar/batch event broadcast to subscribers and event-driven
  completion waiters used by `WaitJob` (`eventsManager.ts`).
- Bounded per-job log buffers (`jobLogsManager.ts:19`).
- Client-job ownership tracking (`clientOwnership.ts`) and disconnect-time release/requeue (`clientTracking.ts`).

Does NOT own:

- Event _emission_ — the queue engine calls `eventsManager.broadcast(...)` and operations call `webhookManager.trigger(...)`; this module never decides when a job changes state. See [Job Lifecycle](./job-lifecycle.md) and [Core Queue Engine](./core-queue-engine.md).
- Transport/fan-out plumbing — SSE/WebSocket streaming, the `/webhooks/*` HTTP routes, and the `Stats`/`Metrics` payloads live in [HTTP / REST / SSE / WebSocket API](./http-api.md) and [Stats, Metrics & Monitoring](./stats-and-monitoring.md).

Every `EventsManager.broadcast` and `broadcastBatch` is also consumed by the
manager-owned `QueueTelemetryJournal`. That subscriber persists a bounded per-queue
lifecycle journal for `trimEvents`, even when no user listener or webhook is
registered. Terminal completed/failed events update a separate minute-metrics
store; retry-attempt failures stay in the journal but do not increment failed
metrics.

- Persistence — webhooks and job logs are in-memory only in the memory/SQLite
  engine. PostgreSQL mode persists job logs and lifecycle events, but webhook
  definitions/delivery remain process-local. See [Persistence](./persistence.md)
  and [PostgreSQL 15–18 Multi-Broker Persistence](./postgres-multibroker.md).
- Stall recovery — `clientTracking` only _triggers_ recovery (resets heartbeats); the stall detector in [Background Tasks](./background-tasks.md) reclaims orphaned jobs.

## Dependencies

Internal:

- `createWebhook` / `Webhook` / `WebhookPayload` / `WEBHOOK_EVENTS` from `src/domain/types/webhook.ts`.
- `validateWebhookUrl` from `src/shared/webhookValidation.ts` (SSRF guard).
- `EventType` / `JobEvent` from `src/domain/types/queue.ts`; `JobLogEntry` / `createLogEntry` from `src/domain/types/worker.ts`.
- `MapLike` (LRU) from `src/shared/lru` for the job-log store; `withWriteLock` + `shardIndex` for `clientTracking`. See [Concurrency & Locking](./concurrency-and-locking.md) and [Data Structures](./data-structures.md).
- `webhookLog` logger.

External / runtime (Bun):

- `Bun.CryptoHasher('sha256', secret)` for HMAC signing (`webhookManager.ts:23`).
- Global `fetch` + `AbortSignal.timeout(10000)` for delivery; `Bun.sleep` for retry backoff (`webhookManager.ts:144`).

Command shapes: `src/domain/types/commands/monitoring.ts:3-28` (logs and webhooks) and `src/domain/types/commands/extended.ts:3-7` (`ClearLogs`). Handlers: `src/infrastructure/server/handlers/monitoring/health.ts:24-50` (`AddLog`/`GetLogs`), `src/infrastructure/server/handlers/monitoring/webhooks.ts:13-100`, and `src/infrastructure/server/handlers/monitoring/operations.ts:21-27` (`ClearLogs`). Routing: `src/infrastructure/server/handler-routes/monitoring.ts:45-87`.

### HTTP endpoints (thin wrappers over the TCP commands)

- `GET /webhooks` · `POST /webhooks` · `DELETE /webhooks/:id` · `PUT /webhooks/:id/enabled` (`httpRouteResources.ts:85`).
- `GET /jobs/:id/logs` · `POST /jobs/:id/logs` · `DELETE /jobs/:id/logs` (`http-routes/jobAdvanced.ts:54-75`).

### Events

- **Webhook events** (`WEBHOOK_EVENTS`, `webhook.ts:16`): `job.pushed`, `job.started`, `job.completed`, `job.failed`, `job.progress`. `job.stalled` is a legacy member of the `WebhookEvent` type kept only for backward compatibility with stored webhooks — it is never emitted and is rejected on new webhooks (`webhook.ts:24`).
- **Internal `EventType`** (`src/domain/types/queue.ts:129-145`): `pushed`, `pulled`, `completed`, `failed`, `progress`, `stalled`, `removed`, `delayed`, `duplicated`, `retried`, `waiting-children`, `drained`, `paused`, `resumed`.
- **TCP event envelope**: `{ type: 'event', event: JobEvent }`, sent only to
  authenticated connections subscribed to `event.queue`.
- **Dashboard events** emitted via `setDashboardEmit`: `webhook:fired`, `webhook:failed`, `webhook:enabled`, `webhook:disabled` (from `WebhookManager`); `webhook:added` / `webhook:removed` are emitted by the handler through `queueManager.emitDashboardEvent` (`handlers/monitoring/webhooks.ts:31-64`).

## Data Models

See [data-model](../data-model.md) for full definitions. Most relevant here:

```ts
interface Webhook {
  // webhook.ts:31
  id: WebhookId;
  url: string;
  events: WebhookEvent[];
  queue: string | null; // null = all queues
  secret: string | null; // null = no HMAC signature
  createdAt: number;
  lastTriggered: number | null;
  successCount: number;
  failureCount: number;
  enabled: boolean;
}

interface WebhookPayload {
  // webhook.ts:66 — the JSON POST body
  event: WebhookEvent;
  timestamp: number;
  jobId: string;
  queue: string;
  data?: unknown;
  error?: string;
  progress?: number;
}

interface JobEvent {
  // src/domain/types/queue.ts:148-162 — internal broadcast shape
  eventType: EventType;
  queue: string;
  jobId: string;
  timestamp: number;
  data?: unknown;
  error?: string;
  progress?: number;
  prev?: string;
  delay?: number;
  terminal?: boolean; // failed only: false when the attempt will be retried
}

interface JobLogEntry {
  timestamp: number;
  level: 'info' | 'warn' | 'error';
  message: string;
} // src/domain/types/worker.ts:63-67
```

> Note: `src/domain/types/queue.ts:164-170` also declares a second, unused `Webhook` interface (with `EventType[]` events). The authoritative type used by `WebhookManager` is the one in `src/domain/types/webhook.ts`.

## Business Logic / Control Flow

### Event broadcast → webhook delivery

1. The queue engine builds a `JobEvent` and calls `eventsManager.broadcast(...)`.
   `PUSHB`, `PULLB`, and `ACKB` instead build an ordered array and call
   `broadcastBatch(...)`.
2. `broadcast` computes `hasSubscribers`, `hasWebhooks` (`webhookManager.hasEnabledWebhooks()`), and `hasWaiters` (only for `Completed`). **Fast path:** if all three are false it returns immediately, doing zero work (`eventsManager.ts:133`).
3. Subscribers are invoked in a try/catch — a throwing subscriber is swallowed so one bad listener can't break the fan-out (`eventsManager.ts:139`).
4. For `Completed`, all completion waiters for that `jobId` are resolved and the map entry deleted (`eventsManager.ts:149`).
5. If webhooks are enabled, `mapEventToWebhook` translates the `EventType` (`pushed→job.pushed`, `pulled→job.started`, `completed→job.completed`, `failed→job.failed`; everything else → `null`/no webhook) and calls `webhookManager.trigger(...)` fire-and-forget (`eventsManager.ts:164`).

The optional batch callback is an internal optimization used by the telemetry
journal. It receives the array once; regular subscribers are still called once
per event in input order, completion waiters resolve per completed ID, and
webhook mapping/delivery remains per event. Both callback forms isolate thrown
subscriber errors. The durable journal batch runs before ordinary subscriber
fan-out, so callbacks observe the complete batch's telemetry state rather than
a partially persisted prefix.

The TCP registry is one of those subscribers while at least one remote queue
subscription exists. It filters by the socket's selected queue, frames the
event once for all matching sockets, and writes through each socket's bounded
`SocketWriteQueue`. `QueueEvents` maps that internal shape to its typed public
payloads; TCP Workers reuse the same dedicated subscription for `stalled`.
`failed` is broadcast for every failed attempt with `terminal: !wasRetried`
(`operations/ack/failure.ts`); the lock-expiry and flow-parent DLQ paths send
no flag. The stall detector's DLQ move broadcasts only `stalled`
(`stallDetection.ts`); removing a waiting job broadcasts `removed`, while
drain, obliterate and clean broadcast no per-job event. `QueueEvents` reports
`terminal: event.terminal !== false`, so an event without the flag counts as
terminal; the client job waits skip `failed` events whose `terminal` is
`false`, re-read the job on `stalled` and `removed`, and re-read periodically
for the moves without a job event (see [Client SDK: Queue](./client-queue-sdk.md)).

`job.progress` is broadcast to internal subscribers, including the telemetry journal and live queue-event transports, by `updateJobProgress`. Because `mapEventToWebhook` intentionally has no progress mapping, the same operation separately calls `webhookManager.trigger('job.progress', ...)` (`src/application/operations/jobManagement.ts:170-188`).

### Webhook delivery

1. `trigger` builds the `WebhookPayload`, filters webhooks by `enabled && events.includes(event) && (queue === null || queue === eventQueue)`, then fires each `sendWebhook` fire-and-forget (`webhookManager.ts:115`).
2. `sendWebhook` POSTs JSON with headers `Content-Type: application/json`, `X-Webhook-Event`, `X-Webhook-Timestamp`, and — if a secret is set — `X-Webhook-Signature` = hex HMAC-SHA256 of the body (`webhookManager.ts:128`).
3. Up to `maxRetries` attempts. A 2xx response sets `lastTriggered`, increments `successCount`, emits `webhook:fired`, and returns. Non-2xx or thrown errors record `lastError`; between attempts it sleeps `retryDelay * (attempt + 1)` (linear backoff). After exhausting retries it increments `failureCount`, emits `webhook:failed`, and throws (the throw is caught by the fire-and-forget caller) (`webhookManager.ts:142`).

### Job logs

`addJobLog` returns `false` if the job isn't in `jobIndex` (so logs can't be added to unknown/evicted jobs). Otherwise it appends `createLogEntry(message, level)` and trims the per-job array to the most recent `maxLogsPerJob` entries via `splice` (`jobLogsManager.ts:19-37`). `GetLogs` returns the full array unless `start`/`end` are supplied, in which case it slices `[start .. end]` inclusive and still reports the untrimmed `count` (`handlers/monitoring/health.ts:39-50`). `clearJobLogs` deletes the entry entirely when `keepLogs` is unset/≤0, else keeps the most recent N (`jobLogsManager.ts:46-56`).

### Client tracking & disconnect release

- `registerClientJob` (on PULL) and `unregisterClientJob` (on ACK/FAIL) maintain `clientJobs: Map<clientId, Set<jobId>>`, deleting the set when empty, together with its reverse index `clientJobOwners: Map<jobId, ClientJobOwner>` (`clientOwnership.ts`). Every mutation of the two maps goes through that module, so a job is in `clientJobs.get(c)` exactly when its owner record names `c`, and every operation is O(1) per job.
- **Delivery identity.** The owner record stores the `jobIndex` entry current at registration. Only a pull installs a `{ type: 'processing' }` entry and every pull installs a fresh object, so the record identifies one delivery: a later delivery of the same job id never matches it. `ownsCurrentDelivery(clientId, jobId)` is true only when the record names the client and the job's current `jobIndex` entry is that same processing object.
- **One owner per delivery.** `registerClientJob` detaches any previous owner of the job before recording the new one. `unregisterClientJob` removes only the caller's own claim, so a late outcome handled on one connection cannot detach a newer delivery owned by another.
- **Every delivery-ending transition detaches the owner** (`detachClientJob`): stall retry/DLQ (`handleStalledJob`, which cleanup's orphan recovery also uses), lock expiration (`processExpiredLockInner`), processing timeout (`retireTimedOutGeneration`), management claims (`releaseClaimedJobOwnership`: move to wait/delayed/waiting-children, discard), a stale-lease replacement in `createLock`, disconnect release itself (`releaseJobToQueue`) and obliterate. Before this, stall and orphan recovery and lock expiration left the job in the silent connection's set; when that connection finally closed, `releaseClientJobs` released the job's new delivery owned by another client and it ran twice (`test/repro-recovered-job-stale-client-release.test.ts`, `test/client-ownership-recovery.test.ts`).
- **Pruning.** An ACK/FAIL sent on another pooled connection than the pull unregisters the sender, not the owner. Cleanup's `pruneEndedClientDeliveries` drops every record whose delivery ended (its `jobIndex` entry is no longer the registered one), so with SQLite or in-memory storage ownership is bounded by live deliveries plus at most one cleanup interval of ended ones. Only a record whose current `jobIndex` entry is the registered processing delivery survives, so a registration that arrives after its delivery ended is pruned too. **PostgreSQL limitation:** PostgreSQL mode runs no cleanup and keeps no local `jobIndex`, so a record left by an outcome sent on another pooled connection lives until the pulling connection closes, as `clientJobs` entries already did.
- On disconnect, the TCP server calls `releaseClientJobsWithRetry` (3 attempts, exponential backoff 100/200/400 ms) → `releaseClientJobs`; on persistent lock failure it falls back to `forceReleaseClientJobs` (`src/infrastructure/server/tcp/connections.ts:87-111`, retry loop in `src/infrastructure/server/tcp/clientRelease.ts:4-22`). SSE disconnect calls `releaseClientJobs` directly (`sseHandler.ts:255-260`).
- `releaseClientJobs` runs in three phases: (1) collect lock-free, keeping only `processing` jobs that pass `isReleasable` (the client owns the current delivery and its lock, if any, has `renewalCount === 0`); (2) group by processing shard then queue shard; (3) acquire **shardLock → processingLock**, re-run `isReleasable` against the locked state and call `releaseJobToQueue` (`clientTracking.ts`). A stale registration (for example one a future transition forgot to detach) therefore cannot release a later delivery owned by another worker.
- `releaseJobToQueue` removes the job from the processing shard, deletes its lock, detaches its ownership, releases concurrency/uniqueKey/groupId resources, then either **discards** cron `preventOverlap` jobs (uniqueKey `cron:*` → deleted, not requeued, fixing the #73 "starts right away on reconnect" bug) or re-queues it with `startedAt=null` and re-indexed as `{ type: 'queue' }`.

## Concurrency & Locking

- `releaseClientJobs` follows the project lock hierarchy: **shardLocks before processingLocks** (`clientTracking.ts`). Reads (phase 1) are lock-free; the release decision is repeated and the mutations happen under both locks.
- The `renewalCount > 0` guard prevents a **double-execute** race: with a pooled client, heartbeats travel on a different connection than the one that pulled, so the pulling socket closing does not mean the worker died — such jobs are left for lock-expiry/stall detection to reclaim (`isReleasable`, `clientTracking.ts`).
- `forceReleaseClientJobs` is intentionally lock-free and acts only on deliveries the client still owns (`ownsCurrentDelivery`): for each it drops `jobLocks[jobId]` (no stale token survives the disconnect) and sets `lastHeartbeat = 0` and `startedAt = 0` so the stall detector's grace gate passes on its next eligible tick. A job recovered from the client and delivered again keeps the new owner's lock and timers. It accepts that a concurrent stall/lock-expiry path may mutate the same job — worst case the write lands on an object no longer in the map (wasted, never corrupting) (`clientTracking.ts`).
- `releaseClientJobs` drops the client (`dropClient`: its `clientJobs` set and only its own owner records) in a `finally` block even on mid-flight lock failure, preventing an unbounded leak across disconnects that hit lock timeouts (`clientTracking.ts`).

The PostgreSQL adapter keeps the same connection-facing contract with durable
lease ownership. Disconnect release row-locks the exact generation and only
requeues a still-live, never-renewed token. A heartbeat received by another
broker increments `lease_renewals` and transfers `lease_broker_id`, so loss of
the original pull socket cannot double-deliver the job. Broker shutdown releases
its remaining untransferred leases; expired protected cron leases are discarded.

- `EventsManager`/`WebhookManager` hold no locks; `broadcast` and
  `broadcastBatch` are synchronous and webhook delivery is async
  fire-and-forget.

## Edge Cases & Failure Modes

- **SSRF protection:** `validateWebhookUrl` (on by default; disabled via `validateUrls: false`) rejects non-http(s) schemes, URLs > 2048 chars, localhost variants, private IPv4 (`10.*`, `172.16–31.*`, `192.168.*`), link-local `169.254.*`, `0.*`, `127.*`, **IPv4-mapped / IPv4-compatible IPv6** whose embedded IPv4 is loopback/private (`extractMappedIpv4` unwraps the dotted `::ffff:127.0.0.1`, the URL-parser-normalized hex form `[::ffff:7f00:1]`, **and** the deprecated `::`-prefixed compatible form `[::127.0.0.1]`/`[::7f00:1]` before the octet check), **IPv6 ULA `fc00::/7` and link-local `fe80::/10`** plus the unspecified `::` (`checkBlockedIpv6`), and cloud-metadata hosts (`169.254.169.254`, `metadata.google.internal`, `*.internal`) (`webhookValidation.ts:42`).
- **Dead-event rejection:** `AddWebhook` rejects events not in `WEBHOOK_EVENTS`, so a webhook can't be created against an event that would silently never fire (`handlers/monitoring/webhooks.ts:13-29`).
- **Delivery is best-effort / fire-and-forget:** failures are logged and counted
  but never block job processing. There is no persistent retry queue, and
  webhook definitions are in-memory in both SQLite and PostgreSQL modes, so
  they are lost on broker restart.
- **Fixed 10 s per-request timeout** via `AbortSignal.timeout(10000)`; linear (not exponential) inter-attempt backoff.
- **`hasEnabledWebhooks` / `getStats` are O(1)** thanks to the `enabledCount` running counter maintained in `add`/`remove`/`setEnabled` (`webhookManager.ts:39`).
- **Completion-waiter memory safety:** `waitForJobCompletion` registers a timer that, on timeout, marks the waiter `cancelled`, splices it out, and deletes empty arrays — preventing a leak when `WaitJob` times out without completion (`eventsManager.ts:78`). `clear()` resolves all outstanding non-cancelled waiters on shutdown.
- **Subscriber isolation:** exceptions thrown by scalar or batch subscribers
  are caught and ignored; a failed telemetry batch performs isolated scalar
  retries before returning.
- **Job-log bounds:** per-job cap is `maxLogsPerJob = 100` (`queue-manager/state.ts`); the `jobLogs` LRU itself holds at most `maxJobLogs = 10_000` distinct jobs (`application/types/config.ts`), evicting whole-job entries. Adding logs to a job not in `jobIndex` returns `false`.
- **Cron `preventOverlap` invariant:** disconnect release must discard (not requeue) `cron:*` jobs, or they re-run immediately on reconnect (#73).

## Configuration

| Env var                  | Default | Effect                                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `WEBHOOK_MAX_RETRIES`    | `3`     | Max delivery attempts per webhook (`webhookManager.ts:17`)                             |
| `WEBHOOK_RETRY_DELAY_MS` | `1000`  | Base inter-attempt delay; actual wait = `delay * (attempt+1)` (`webhookManager.ts:20`) |

Options (not env): `WebhookManager({ validateUrls })` — defaults ON; wired from `config.validateWebhookUrls` in `queue-manager/state.ts`. Job-log bounds: `maxLogsPerJob = 100`, `maxJobLogs = 10_000` (config default). Webhook fetch timeout is a hardcoded 10 000 ms.
