# Client Transport (TCP pool, reconnect, batching)

> **Category:** Client SDK · **Source:** `src/client/tcpPool.ts`, `src/client/tcp/`, `src/client/tcp/runtime/`, `src/client/tcp/types/`, `src/client/tcpClient.ts`, `src/client/queue/addBatcher.ts`, `src/client/queue-events/tcpSubscription.ts`

## Purpose

The client transport layer is the wire-level plumbing that the [Queue](./client-queue-sdk.md) and [Worker](./client-worker-sdk.md) SDKs use to talk to a remote bunqueue server over TCP. It owns the socket lifecycle: a load-aware connection pool (`TcpConnectionPool`), per-connection request/response multiplexing with msgpack framing and reqId-based pipelining (`TcpClient`), ordered short-write buffering, automatic reconnection with exponential backoff (`ReconnectManager`), liveness detection via ping and half-open-socket recovery (`HealthTracker`), optional TLS, and transparent write coalescing of `add()` calls (`AddBatcher`). It exists so the higher-level SDKs can issue command objects and await responses without managing sockets, retries, or batching themselves.

## Responsibilities & Scope

Owns:
- TCP connection establishment (plaintext or TLS), `connectTimeout` enforcement, and OS-level TCP keepalive setup (`tcp/transport.ts:43-189`).
- Frame parsing / framing of msgpack-encoded command and response objects (delegated to `FrameParser` from the [TCP protocol](./tcp-protocol.md) module).
- Per-physical-socket outbound ordering: partial `Bun.Socket.write()` results are
  retained, later frames queue behind the missing tail, and `drain` resumes the
  write without replaying bytes across reconnects.
- Request/response correlation via per-command `reqId`, pipelining up to `maxInFlight` commands, and per-command timeouts.
- Dispatch of unsolicited `{ type: 'event', event: JobEvent }` frames before
  request correlation, so a subscription event cannot satisfy or reorder an
  in-flight command.
- Reconnection scheduling with exponential backoff + jitter and a configurable attempt cap.
- Connection health: periodic ping, ping-failure counting, and half-open detection (sustained command timeouts force a reconnect, #94).
- Pooling: round-robin load-aware client selection, reference-counted shared pools keyed by `host:port:poolSize:token:tls`.
- Auto-batching of `Queue.add()` calls into a single `addBulk`/`PUSHB` round-trip.
- Dedicated authenticated, reconnecting queue-event subscriptions used by
  `QueueEvents` and TCP Worker `stalled` notifications.

Does NOT own:
- The wire format / framing algorithm itself — see [TCP Wire Protocol & Framing](./tcp-protocol.md) (`FrameParser`, `pack`/`unpack`).
- Command semantics (what `PUSH`/`PULL`/`ACK` do server-side) — see [TCP Server Command Handlers](./tcp-server-handlers.md) and [Job Lifecycle](./job-lifecycle.md).
- Embedded (in-process) mode — when `embedded: true`, the SDK bypasses this layer entirely and the pool/batcher are `null` (`queue/runtime/state.ts:31-38`).
- Higher-level retry/DLQ/stall policy — see [Client SDK: Queue](./client-queue-sdk.md).
- Worker re-registration logic (the transport only emits the `connected`/reconnect signal; the Worker reacts).

## Dependencies

Internal:
- `FrameParser`, `FrameSizeError` from `src/infrastructure/server/protocol` — see [TCP Wire Protocol & Framing](./tcp-protocol.md). Used for `FrameParser.frame(...)` on write and incremental `addData(...)` on read.
- `SocketWriteQueue` from `src/infrastructure/server/socketWriteQueue.ts` — the
  same ordered short-write primitive used by the server response path.
- Consumed by [Client SDK: Queue](./client-queue-sdk.md) (`queue.ts` wires `TcpConnectionPool` + `AddBatcher`), [Client SDK: Worker](./client-worker-sdk.md) (`worker.ts` creates a pool sized `min(concurrency, 8)` and subscribes via `onReconnect`), and [Store-and-Forward](./store-and-forward.md).

External / runtime:
- `Bun.connect` (TCP socket), `node:fs` `readFileSync` (TLS CA file, read into bytes), `Bun.hash` (pool key hashing).
- `msgpackr` — `pack` / `unpack` for the binary protocol.
- Node `events.EventEmitter` (base class for `TcpClient` and `ReconnectManager`).

## Public Interface

### Classes

`TcpConnectionPool` (`tcpPool.ts:20`) — pool of `TcpClient`s:
```typescript
constructor(options: PoolOptions = {})           // PoolOptions extends Partial<ConnectionOptions> + { poolSize?: number }
async connect(): Promise<void>                    // connect all clients in parallel
async send(command: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<Record<string, unknown>>
async sendParallel(commands: Array<Record<string, unknown>>): Promise<Array<Record<string, unknown>>>
onReconnect(cb: () => void): void                 // fires on every (re)connect of any pooled client
isConnected(): boolean
getConnectedCount(): number
getPoolSize(): number
addRef(): void                                    // shared-pool refcount
release(): void                                   // decrement; close() at zero
close(): void
isClosed(): boolean
getHealth(): { healthy; connectedCount; totalCount; clients: ConnectionHealth[]; avgLatencyMs; totalCommands; totalErrors }
```

Module functions (`tcpPool.ts`):
- `getSharedPool(options?: PoolOptions): TcpConnectionPool` — get-or-create a refcounted pool keyed by `getPoolKey` (`tcpPool.ts:229-269`).
- `releaseSharedPool(pool): void`, `closeAllSharedPools(): void`.

`TcpClient extends EventEmitter` (`tcp/client.ts:7`, through its runtime base classes) — single connection:
```typescript
constructor(options: Partial<ConnectionOptions> = {})
async connect(): Promise<void>
async send(command: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<Record<string, unknown>>
async hello(): Promise<HelloResponse>
async ping(): Promise<boolean>
close(): void
isConnected(): boolean
getState(): 'connected' | 'connecting' | 'disconnected' | 'closed'
getHealth(): ConnectionHealth
getInFlightCount(): number
```

`ReconnectManager extends EventEmitter` (`tcp/reconnect.ts:19`): `setClosed`, `isClosed`, `reset`, `cancelReconnect`, `canReconnect`, `scheduleReconnect(connectFn)`.

`HealthTracker` (`tcp/health.ts:25`): `recordSuccess`, `recordError`, `recordConnected`, `recordPingSuccess`, `recordPingFailure(): boolean`, `recordCommandTimeout(): boolean`, `getHealth(state)`, `startPing(fn)`, `stopPing`.

`CommandQueue` (`tcp/commandQueue.ts:4`): `enqueue`, `dequeue`, `remove(id)`, `addInFlight`, `removeByReqId`, `canSendMore(maxInFlight)`, `hasPending`, `getInFlightCount`, `rejectAll(error)`.

`AddBatcher<T>` (`queue/addBatcher.ts:44`):
```typescript
constructor(config: AddBatcherConfig, flushCb: FlushCallback<T>)
enqueue(name, data, opts?): Promise<Job<T>>
async flush(): Promise<void>
async waitForInFlight(): Promise<void>
stop(): void                                      // rejects remaining pending with "AddBatcher stopped"
hasPending(): boolean
```

`ClientClosedError extends Error` (`tcp/errors.ts:10`) — sentinel for the synthetic rejection issued by `close()`/`rejectAll()`. Its prototype carries the non-enumerable global brand `Symbol.for('bunqueue.ClientClosedError')` (`tcp/errors.ts:17`), so every bunqueue copy loaded in one process recognizes another copy's instances; a foreign error merely named `ClientClosedError` (e.g. undici's) does not carry it.

`installClientClosedFilter(): void` (`tcp/errors.ts:52-55`) — internal; installs the process `unhandledRejection` filter described under Edge cases unless a bunqueue filter is already registered.

Helpers: `createConnection(target, connectTimeout, events): Promise<ConnectionResult>` and `buildClientTls(tls)` (`tcp/transport.ts:43-189`, `tcp/transport.ts:26-35`).

`src/client/tcpClient.ts` is a deprecated re-export shim (`@deprecated Import from './tcp' instead`) that re-exports `TcpClient`, `getSharedTcpClient`, `closeSharedTcpClient`, `DEFAULT_CONNECTION`, and the `ConnectionOptions`/`ConnectionHealth` types. Shared single-client variants live in `tcp/shared.ts` (`getSharedTcpClient`, `closeSharedTcpClient`).

### TCP commands issued by this layer

- `Hello` — explicit protocol-version and capability negotiation via `hello()` (`tcp/runtime/commands.ts:10-21`).
- `Auth` — sent via `sendDirect` during `doConnect` when a `token` is configured (`tcp/runtime/connectivity.ts:52-90`).
- `Ping` — sent by the health timer and by the Worker heartbeat path.
- `SubscribeEvents` / `UnsubscribeEvents` — select or clear the one queue event
  stream associated with a dedicated connection.
- All other commands (`PUSH`, `PUSHB`, `PULL`, `ACK`, `FAIL`, queries, control, …) pass through opaquely as `Record<string, unknown>`; the transport adds a `reqId` field and reads `response.reqId`.

### Events emitted (`TcpClient`)

`connected`, `disconnected`, `reconnecting` (`{ attempt, delay }`), `maxReconnectAttemptsReached`, `error` (`Error`), `warning` (`{ type, reqId? }`; types `unknown_response`, `malformed_frame`), `health` (`{ type, latency?, reason? }`; types `ping_success`, `ping_failed`, `unhealthy`), and the internal typed `queueEvent` (`JobEvent`) consumed by `TcpEventSubscription`. `ReconnectManager` emits `reconnecting` and `maxReconnectAttemptsReached`.

## Data Models

Key shapes defined by this layer:

`ConnectionOptions` (`tcp/types/connection.ts:3-19`) with `DEFAULT_CONNECTION` (`tcp/types/connection.ts:34-50`): `host='localhost'`, `port=6789`, `token=''`, `tls=false`, `maxReconnectAttempts=Infinity`, `reconnectDelay=100`, `maxReconnectDelay=30000`, `connectTimeout=5000`, `commandTimeout=30000`, `autoReconnect=true`, `pingInterval=30000`, `maxPingFailures=3`, `maxCommandTimeouts=3`, `pipelining=true`, `maxInFlight=100`.

`ClientTlsOptions` (`tcp/types/tls.ts:1-4`): `{ rejectUnauthorized?: boolean; caFile?: string }`. `tls` accepts `boolean | ClientTlsOptions`.

`PoolOptions` (`tcpPool.ts:8`) = `Partial<ConnectionOptions>` + `poolSize?` (default 4, floored to `>= 1`).

`PendingCommand` (`tcp/types/command.ts:1-9`): `{ id, reqId, command, resolve, reject, timeout, promise? }`.

`ConnectionHealth` (`tcp/types/connection.ts:21-32`): `{ healthy, state, lastSuccessAt, lastErrorAt, avgLatencyMs, consecutivePingFailures, consecutiveCommandTimeouts, totalCommands, totalErrors, uptimeMs }`.

`AutoBatchOptions` (`client/types/connection.ts:20-24`): `{ enabled?: boolean; maxSize?=50; maxDelayMs?=5 }`. `AddBatcherConfig` (`queue/addBatcher.ts:23-30`) adds `maxPending?` (default 10000).

## Business Logic / Control Flow

### Send path (pipelined)
1. `TcpConnectionPool.send` rejects if closed, else picks a client via `getNextClient` (`tcpPool.ts:82-107`): scans from `currentIndex` for the first `isConnected()` client (advancing `currentIndex`); if all are down it falls back to plain round-robin so the chosen client triggers its own reconnect.
2. `TcpClient.send` (`tcp/runtime/commands.ts:86-137`) assigns a monotonic `id` and a wrapped `reqId` (`generateReqId` masks to 31 bits, `tcp/runtime/health.ts:134-137`), enqueues the `PendingCommand`, then: if disconnected and not connecting it kicks off `connect().catch(()=>{})`; if connected it calls `processQueue`.
3. `processQueue` drains the command queue while `hasPending()` and
   `canSendMore(maxInFlight)`, (re)arms the timeout, moves the command to
   in-flight, and frames it. `createConnection` sends the bytes through one
   `SocketWriteQueue` owned by that physical socket. A short write retains the
   exact tail; later frames wait behind it until Bun invokes `drain`.
4. On inbound data, the socket feeds bytes to `frameParser.addData(data)` and
   dispatches each complete frame to `handleData`. A validated `type:'event'`
   envelope emits `queueEvent` and returns immediately. Every other frame
   follows request correlation: match `response.reqId` against in-flight,
   clear its timeout, resolve, and re-run `processQueue` to send more.

### Dedicated event subscription

`TcpEventSubscription` owns one `TcpClient` and one queue key. It resolves the
same token and connection defaults as the queue/worker transport, connects and
authenticates first, sends `SubscribeEvents`, and reports ready only after the
acknowledgement. A disconnect invalidates the current generation; the client's
normal reconnect emits `connected`, which starts exactly one fresh subscription
attempt. `close()` invalidates pending work and closes the socket, so no event
can be delivered after teardown.

### Connect path
`doConnect` (`tcp/runtime/connectivity.ts:52-90`) calls `createConnection` (msgpack over `Bun.connect`, TLS via `buildClientTls`), enables TCP keepalive (`setKeepAlive(true, 15000)`, best-effort, `tcp/transport.ts:97-118`), authenticates via `sendDirect({cmd:'Auth'})` when a token is set, then marks connected and `recordConnected()`. `connect` (`tcp/runtime/connectivity.ts:11-33`) resets the reconnect counter, emits `connected`, starts the ping timer, and flushes the queue. Concurrent `connect()` calls dedupe through `waitForConnection` (`tcp/runtime/connectivity.ts:37-50`).

### TLS server-certificate verification (#109)

`Bun.connect` does **not** reject an unauthorized peer on the client side — it completes the socket regardless of `ca`/`rejectUnauthorized`. It does, however, compute the peer's authorization result and pass it to the `handshake(socket, success, authorizationError)` callback. `createConnection` enforces it there: `tlsRequiresVerification` (`tcp/transport.ts:37-41`) treats verification as the default for any TLS connection and only an explicit `rejectUnauthorized: false` opts out (encryption-only). On a required-verification connection a non-null `authorizationError` (wrong/absent CA, self-signed, hostname mismatch) closes the socket and rejects with `TLS verification failed: <reason>`; otherwise the connection resolves (`tcp/transport.ts:119-136`).

Two ordering facts drive the implementation: (1) `buildClientTls` reads `caFile` into **bytes** (`readFileSync`) rather than passing a `Bun.file` handle, so Bun computes `authorizationError` against the pinned CA; (2) once a `handshake` handler is registered, Bun fires `open` **before** the TLS handshake completes (without one, `open` fires only after). So for every TLS connection the resolve is gated on `handshake`, not `open` — resolving in `open` would let the pool write its first command onto a socket whose handshake is still in flight and lose the bytes. Plaintext has no handshake event and still resolves in `open`.

### Reconnect path
On close/error/forced teardown, `scheduleReconnect` (`reconnect.ts:79`) increments `reconnectAttempts`, emits `maxReconnectAttemptsReached` (and stops) once it exceeds `maxReconnectAttempts`, else computes `baseDelay = min(reconnectDelay * 2^(attempt-1), maxReconnectDelay)` plus `Math.random()*0.3*baseDelay` jitter, emits `reconnecting`, and arms a single timer (guards against double-scheduling via `reconnectTimer`/`closed`).

### Half-open detection (#94)
A dead peer with no FIN/RST leaves writes succeeding while no response returns. Two recovery signals: (a) ping failures — `handlePingFailure` (`tcp/runtime/health.ts:96-103`) forces reconnect once `recordPingFailure()` hits `maxPingFailures`; (b) command timeouts — `handleCommandTimeout` (`tcp/runtime/health.ts:105-110`) forces reconnect once `recordCommandTimeout()` hits `maxCommandTimeouts` (default 3, 0 disables). Any successful command or ping resets the consecutive-timeout counter (`tcp/health.ts:40-48`, `tcp/health.ts:68-74`), so it only fires on a sustained run. `forceReconnect` (`tcp/runtime/health.ts:112-126`) tears down the socket (swallowing `end()` errors), `rejectAll`s in-flight commands immediately (preventing stale timeouts from re-triggering a reconnect storm), and reschedules.

### Auto-batch path
`Queue.add` routes through `AddBatcher.enqueue` unless `opts.durable` is set or the batcher is disabled (`queue/runtime/queries.ts:10-15`). `enqueue` (`queue/addBatcher.ts:61-91`) pushes the entry, then: flush immediately if `pending.length >= maxSize`; **also** flush immediately if no flush is in-flight (`!this.flushing`) — this gives sequential `await`ed adds zero added latency; otherwise arm a `maxDelayMs` timer so concurrent adds coalesce. `doFlush` (`queue/addBatcher.ts:108-119`) loops `flushOnce` until the buffer drains, so items arriving during a flush are batched into the next round-trip. `flushOnce` (`queue/addBatcher.ts:127-150`) splices the whole buffer, calls `flushCb` (which invokes `addBulk` → `PUSHB`), and fan-out-resolves/rejects each caller by index.

## Concurrency & Locking

No mutexes — single-threaded JS event loop. Concurrency is managed by:
- **Pipelining window**: `maxInFlight` (default 100) bounds simultaneously outstanding commands per `TcpClient`; `processQueue` stops dequeuing when the window is full and resumes as responses arrive.
- **Byte-order gate**: the connection-local write queue serializes partially
  written frame tails ahead of every later frame. It is cleared on explicit
  close or disconnect and is never inherited by a replacement socket.
- **reqId correlation**: responses are matched by `reqId` (`inFlightByReqId` map), so out-of-order responses across pipelined commands are handled correctly; a legacy single-command fallback exists in `handleData` (`tcp/runtime/health.ts:27-46`).
- **Connect dedupe**: the `connecting` flag + `waitForConnection` ensure overlapping `connect()` calls share one attempt.
- **Reconnect single-flight**: `scheduleReconnect` no-ops if a timer is already armed or the manager is closed.
- **Batcher flush serialization**: the `flushing` flag plus `inFlightFlushes` set ensure only one flush loop runs at a time; `disconnect()` awaits `flush()` and `waitForInFlight()` before stopping the batcher (`queue/runtime/connection.ts:5-12`).
- **Shared-pool refcounting**: `addRef`/`release` (`tcpPool.ts:154-165`) — the pool closes only when the count hits zero; `getSharedPool` removes a closed pool from the map before recreating. Each Queue records whether it has released its constructor-owned reference, so repeated `close()` calls and `disconnect()` followed by `close()` cannot decrement the same ownership twice or close a peer Queue's pool.

## Edge Cases & Failure Modes

- **Malformed frame**: `handleData` catch (`tcp/runtime/health.ts:19-54`) treats the framed stream as unrecoverable — emits `warning {malformed_frame}`, `rejectAll`s every pending/in-flight command (so they don't hang until per-command timeout), and `forceReconnect`s for a clean stream.
- **Malformed event envelope**: an unsolicited frame must contain a finite
  timestamp and string `eventType`, `queue`, and `jobId`. An invalid envelope is
  treated as a malformed stream and reconnects; it never falls through to the
  legacy current-command response slot.
- **Frame too large**: `FrameSizeError` from `addData` surfaces as an `error` event (`tcp/transport.ts:80-95`) and the read returns without dispatching.
- **Command timeout taxonomy** (`tcp/runtime/commands.ts:93-107`): a still-queued command (never written) is rejected but does NOT count toward dead-link detection; an in-flight command that got no response rejects AND calls `handleCommandTimeout`.
- **Connection lost / close**: `handleClose` (`tcp/runtime/health.ts:57-70`) rejects all in-flight with `Connection lost` and reconnects only if it was previously connected and `canReconnect()`.
- **Outbound short write**: Bun TCP writes are unbuffered and may accept fewer
  bytes than supplied. The accepted prefix is not resent; the remaining tail
  is queued and flushed on `drain`. A closed/throwing socket or a client queue
  above 64 MiB is terminated so pending commands reject instead of waiting for
  a corrupted response stream.
- **Intentional close idempotency / unhandled-rejection safety**: `close` (`tcp/runtime/lifecycle.ts:6-17`) sets closed, stops ping, cancels reconnect, installs the synthetic-close rejection filter (`installClientClosedFilter`, `tcp/errors.ts:36-55`), and `rejectAll`s with `ClientClosedError`. `rejectAll` attaches a silent `.catch` to each `cmd.promise` before rejecting (`tcp/commandQueue.ts:71-91`) so fire-and-forget callers (heartbeats, polling loops) don't surface unhandled rejections; the filter covers derived chains further down whose handler is missing.
- **Close filter must not swallow host rejections**: registering any `unhandledRejection` listener disables the Bun/Node default (print the error, exit 1). The filter therefore: (1) returns for a `ClientClosedError`, identified by `instanceof` or the global brand; (2) returns when any non-bunqueue `unhandledRejection` listener is registered, because that listener owns the rejection and receives it exactly once; (3) otherwise removes itself and re-raises the reason with `Promise.reject(reason)`, so the runtime's configured mode applies (default: crash with exit 1; `--unhandled-rejections=warn`: warning and the process keeps running). The filter function carries `Symbol.for('bunqueue.clientClosedRejectionFilter')`; installation is skipped while any branded filter is registered and is decided from `process.listeners('unhandledRejection')` rather than a module flag, so duplicate bunqueue copies in one process share one filter (two filters would each defer to the other and swallow host rejections again) and the next `close()` re-installs it after it stepped aside or after the host removed all listeners. Before this change, the filter did nothing for foreign reasons and silently swallowed every application rejection (exit 0, no output) after the first TCP client close. Regression: `test/repro-client-closed-filter-swallows-app-rejections.test.ts`.
- **Close filter residuals**: after the filter steps aside, a later leaked `ClientClosedError` from an already-closed client is unfiltered until the next `close()` re-installs it. In `--unhandled-rejections=warn` mode (Bun and Node) the runtime warns about the original rejection even with a listener, so the re-raise prints a second warning. In `--unhandled-rejections=strict` mode the runtime raises the original as an uncaught exception first, so a host `uncaughtException` handler sees the same reason twice. Bun reports a timer-originated rejection immediately but may exit on the next event-loop wakeup; that is the runtime default, with or without the filter.
- **Max reconnect attempts reached**: `TcpClientState` rejects all queued commands with `Max reconnection attempts reached` when the reconnect manager emits its terminal event (`tcp/runtime/state.ts:70-74`).
- **TLS connect failure**: `Bun.connect` may reject (handshake refused) instead of firing `connectError`; the `.catch` in `createConnection` (`tcp/transport.ts:169-181`) routes it to the same rejection so callers never hang past `connectTimeout`.
- **Socket error listener**: `TcpConnectionPool` attaches a no-op `error` listener to each client (`tcpPool.ts:68-73`) so an EventEmitter `error` (e.g. TLS handshake garbage) never crashes the process.
- **Durable bypass**: `durable` jobs skip the batcher and go out as individual `PUSH` (`queue/runtime/queries.ts:10-15`); `Store-and-Forward` disables auto-batch entirely (`forwarder.ts: autoBatch:{enabled:false}`).
- **Batcher overflow**: at `maxPending` (10000) `enqueue` drops and rejects the oldest 10% with `Add buffer overflow - oldest entries dropped` (`queue/addBatcher.ts:68-74`).
- **Batcher stop**: `stop()` rejects all remaining pending with `AddBatcher stopped`; `enqueue` after stop rejects immediately.
- **Memory bound**: `HealthTracker` keeps only the last 10 latencies (`MAX_LATENCY_HISTORY`, `tcp/health.ts:36`) for the rolling average.
- **reqId wrap**: counter masks to `0x7fffffff` (`tcp/runtime/health.ts:134-137`); collisions across a 2^31 window of simultaneously in-flight commands are not defended against (impractical given `maxInFlight`).
- **Pool degraded mode**: when every client is disconnected, `getNextClient` still returns one (round-robin) so the send attempt drives reconnection rather than failing fast.

## Configuration

All knobs come through `ConnectionOptions` / `PoolOptions` (programmatic; no env vars are read directly in this layer). Defaults from `DEFAULT_CONNECTION` (`tcp/types/connection.ts:34-50`):

| Option | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `host` / `port` | `localhost` / `6789` | server target |
| `token` | `''` | sends `Auth` on connect when set |
| `tls` | `false` | `true` = system CAs; object = `{caFile, rejectUnauthorized}` |
| `poolSize` | 4 (Queue); `min(concurrency, 8)` (Worker) | clients per pool, floored to ≥1 |
| `maxReconnectAttempts` | `Infinity` | cap before `maxReconnectAttemptsReached` |
| `reconnectDelay` / `maxReconnectDelay` | 100 / 30000 ms | backoff base / ceiling |
| `connectTimeout` | 5000 ms | per-connect deadline |
| `commandTimeout` | 30000 ms | per-command deadline |
| `autoReconnect` | `true` | enable reconnection |
| `pingInterval` | 30000 ms (0 = off) | health ping cadence |
| `maxPingFailures` | 3 | consecutive ping fails → reconnect |
| `maxCommandTimeouts` | 3 (0 = off) | consecutive timeouts → reconnect (#94) |
| `pipelining` | `true` | forwarded by the pool, but not read by the send path (see caveat below) |
| `maxInFlight` | 100 | pipelining window per `TcpClient` (forwarded by the pool) |
| `autoBatch.maxSize` / `maxDelayMs` / `enabled` | 50 / 5 ms / true (TCP) | `add()` coalescing |
| `autoBatch.maxPending` | 10000 | batcher overflow bound |

Caveat: the `pipelining` flag is declared, defaulted, and forwarded, but never read by `TcpClient` (the reqId send path is unconditional, so pipelining is effectively always on). `TcpConnectionPool` forwards both `pipelining` and `maxInFlight` into every `TcpClient` it constructs (`tcpPool.ts:49-67`), so a `maxInFlight` override takes effect on pooled connections too.

Shared pools are reused only when `poolSize === 4 && !token` for a Queue (`queue/runtime/state.ts:39-70`); otherwise a dedicated pool is created. Pool sharing key (`getPoolKey`, `tcpPool.ts:229-246`) includes host, port, poolSize, a 16-bit token hash, the JSON-stringified TLS config, and `pipelining`/`maxInFlight`, so plaintext and TLS pools to the same target never alias and Queues with different pipelining windows never share a pool.
