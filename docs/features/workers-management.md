# Worker Registry & Management

> **Category:** Observability · **Source:** `src/application/workerManager.ts`, `src/domain/types/worker.ts`

## Purpose

`WorkerManager` is the server-side registry of connected consumers. It tracks
which workers exist, what queues they serve, their concurrency, liveness
(`lastSeen` heartbeat timestamp), and per-worker job counters (active /
processed / failed). It exists so the server can answer "is anyone consuming
this queue?" (used by `skipIfNoWorker` crons), expose worker fleet state to the
dashboard / HTTP / CLI, and reap connections that vanish without a clean
unregister.

It is purely an observability/coordination registry: it does **not** schedule,
lease, lock, or execute jobs, and it is **not** authoritative for job-level
stall detection.

## Responsibilities & Scope

Owns:

- An in-memory `Map<WorkerId, Worker>` of registered workers (`workerManager.ts:21`).
- Worker registration / re-registration / unregistration, including bulk
  removal by TCP `clientId` on disconnect (`unregisterByClientId`, `workerManager.ts:75`).
- Worker-level heartbeat (`lastSeen` refresh) and client-reported stats
  ingestion (`heartbeat`, `workerManager.ts:94`).
- Aggregate O(1) fleet counters: `totalProcessedCounter`,
  `totalFailedCounter`, `totalActiveJobsCounter` (`workerManager.ts:26-28`).
- Liveness classification via `WORKER_TIMEOUT_MS` and stale-worker reaping
  via a background cleanup interval (`cleanupStale`, `workerManager.ts:217`).
- Emitting dashboard events for worker lifecycle (`worker:disconnected`,
  `worker:idle`, `worker:error`, `worker:removed-stale`).

Does NOT own (delegated elsewhere):

- Job-level stall detection / lock renewal — `JobHeartbeat` / `JobHeartbeatB`
  go to `QueueManager.jobHeartbeat` / `renewJobLock`, **not** to `WorkerManager`
  (`src/infrastructure/server/handlers/monitoring/health.ts:76-102`). See [Background Tasks](./background-tasks.md)
  and [Concurrency & Locking](./concurrency-and-locking.md).
- Job leasing, concurrency enforcement, and pull/ack/fail — see
  [Job Lifecycle](./job-lifecycle.md) and
  [Rate Limiting & Concurrency Control](./rate-limiting-and-concurrency.md).
- The client-side `Worker` that sends these commands — see
  [Client SDK: Worker](./client-worker-sdk.md).
- Persistence: the memory/SQLite registry is **in-memory only**. PostgreSQL
  multi-broker mode durably stores broker/client ownership, queues, payload, and
  `last_seen` in `bunqueue_workers`, making the registry shared across brokers.
  Re-registration transfers ownership atomically; owner-fenced heartbeat and
  unregister operations reject a stale broker or connection generation.
  See [Persistence](./persistence.md) and
  [PostgreSQL 15–18 Multi-Broker Persistence](./postgres-multibroker.md).

## Dependencies

Internal:

- `src/domain/types/worker.ts` — `Worker`, `WorkerId`, `CreateWorkerOptions`,
  `createWorker()`.
- `src/shared/hash` — `uuid()` for generating worker IDs when the client does
  not supply one (`worker.ts:46`).
- Consumed by `QueueManager` (`queue-manager/state.ts`), which owns the singleton
  `workerManager` instance and wires the dashboard emitter and the
  `skipIfNoWorker` callback.

External / runtime:

- `src/shared/workerTimeouts.ts` — `workerTimeoutMs()` and
  `workerCleanupIntervalMs()`, the single accessors for `WORKER_TIMEOUT_MS` and
  `WORKER_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_MS`. Each parses its env var with `parseDurationEnv` on
  first use (not at import) and caches it for the process; the server views
  (`ListWorkers`, dashboard overview, WebSocket/SSE stats, `GET /queues/:q/workers`,
  and the PostgreSQL Cloud adapter's worker stats) read the same accessor. The rules
  and defaults are exported (`WORKER_TIMEOUT_SETTING`,
  `WORKER_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_SETTING`) and reused by the server configuration table,
  and `configureWorkerTimeoutMs(ms)` lets the server apply its resolved
  `WORKER_TIMEOUT_MS` before the QueueManager is built (the config file's
  `timeouts.worker` is ignored with a warning, as it always was).
- `safeInterval` (`src/shared/timers.ts`) for the cleanup loop, stopped with
  `clear()`.
- No external packages, no SQLite, no disk.

## Public Interface

### Exported class — `WorkerManager` (`workerManager.ts:20`)

```typescript
constructor()                                              // reads both settings (throws on a malformed value), starts cleanup interval
setDashboardEmit(callback: (event: string, data: Record<string, unknown>) => void): void
register(name: string, queues: string[], concurrency?: number /* =1 */, opts?: CreateWorkerOptions): Worker
unregister(id: WorkerId): boolean
unregisterByClientId(clientId: string): number             // returns count removed
get(id: WorkerId): Worker | undefined
heartbeat(id: WorkerId, stats?: { activeJobs?: number; processed?: number; failed?: number }): boolean
incrementActive(id: WorkerId, jobId?: string): void
jobCompleted(id: WorkerId): void
jobFailed(id: WorkerId): void
list(): Worker[]
listActive(): Worker[]                                     // lastSeen within WORKER_TIMEOUT_MS
getForQueue(queue: string): Worker[]                       // active workers serving `queue`
stop(): void                                               // clears cleanup interval
getStats(): { total: number; active: number; totalProcessed: number; totalFailed: number; activeJobs: number }
```

### Exported types / fn — `src/domain/types/worker.ts`

- `type WorkerId = string` (`worker.ts:8`)
- `interface Worker` (`worker.ts:11`)
- `interface CreateWorkerOptions` (`worker.ts:29`)
- `createWorker(name, queues?, concurrency=1, opts?): Worker` (`worker.ts:38`)
- `interface JobLogEntry` + `createLogEntry()` also live in this file
  (`worker.ts:63,70`) but belong to [Webhooks, Events & Job Logs](./webhooks-and-events.md),
  not the worker registry.

### Queue client discovery (`src/client/queue/workers.ts`)

```typescript
queue.getWorkers(): Promise<WorkerInfo[]>
queue.getWorkersCount(): Promise<number>
```

Both methods are queue-scoped. Embedded queues read
`WorkerManager.getForQueue(queue)` directly; TCP queues decode
`response.data.workers` from `ListWorkers` and retain only workers whose
`queues` include the queue key. `getWorkersCount` is the length of that same
filtered live view.

### TCP commands handled (via `QueueManager` / `handlers/monitoring.ts`)

- `RegisterWorker` → `handleRegisterWorker` (`src/infrastructure/server/handlers/monitoring/workers.ts:16-51`); fields:
  `name`, `queues`, `concurrency?`, `workerId?`, `hostname?`, `pid?`, `startedAt?`
  (`src/domain/types/commands/workers.ts:24-33`). `clientId` is injected server-side from the connection
  (`src/infrastructure/server/handlers/monitoring/workers.ts:21-31`).
- `UnregisterWorker` → `handleUnregisterWorker` (`src/infrastructure/server/handlers/monitoring/workers.ts:53-61`); field `workerId`.
- `ListWorkers` → `handleListWorkers` (`src/infrastructure/server/handlers/monitoring/workers.ts:63-92`).
- `Heartbeat` (worker-level) → `handleHeartbeat` (`src/infrastructure/server/handlers/monitoring/health.ts:53-74`); fields:
  `id`, `activeJobs?`, `processed?`, `failed?` (`src/domain/types/commands/workers.ts:3-9`). This is the
  only worker command that touches `WorkerManager`. For TCP requests in
  PostgreSQL mode, the handler also supplies the server-derived connection
  `clientId`; the durable update succeeds only for the broker and connection
  that most recently registered that worker ID. A different connection cannot
  heartbeat or unregister the worker, even through another broker. Reconnecting
  workers must therefore re-send `RegisterWorker` before their next heartbeat.
- `JobHeartbeat` / `JobHeartbeatB` → routed to `QueueManager` job-lock subsystem,
  **not** `WorkerManager` (`src/infrastructure/server/handlers/monitoring/health.ts:76-102`).

### HTTP endpoints (`httpRouteResources.ts`, `httpRouteQueues.ts`)

- `GET /workers` → `ListWorkers` (`httpRouteResources.ts:144`)
- `POST /workers` → `RegisterWorker` (`httpRouteResources.ts:150`)
- `DELETE /workers/:id` → `UnregisterWorker` (`httpRouteResources.ts:175`)
- `POST /workers/:id/heartbeat` → `Heartbeat` (`httpRouteResources.ts:187`)
- `GET /queues/:queue/workers` uses `workerManager.getForQueue(queue)` for
  memory/SQLite. PostgreSQL reads the durable namespace registry, filters by
  queue and `WORKER_TIMEOUT_MS`, and therefore includes active workers
  registered through another broker (`httpRouteQueues.ts`).
- Worker fleet is also embedded in the TCP/HTTP dashboard overview and periodic
  WebSocket/SSE stats snapshots. Those surfaces read the shared PostgreSQL
  registry when available and keep the original synchronous local path for
  memory/SQLite.

### CLI subcommands (`src/cli/commands/worker.ts`)

- `bunqueue worker list` → `ListWorkers`
- `bunqueue worker register <name> --queues|-q a,b,c` → `RegisterWorker`
- `bunqueue worker unregister <workerId>` → `UnregisterWorker`

### Dashboard events emitted

`worker:connected` and `worker:disconnected` are emitted by the `QueueManager`
wrappers in `queue-manager/services.ts`. `WorkerManager` itself emits:

- `worker:disconnected` — per worker removed in `unregisterByClientId` (`workerManager.ts:82`)
- `worker:idle` — when a worker's `activeJobs` reaches 0 (`workerManager.ts:148,166`)
- `worker:error` — at cumulative failure thresholds 5/10/25/50/100 (`workerManager.ts:178`)
- `worker:removed-stale` — when the cleanup loop reaps a dead worker (`workerManager.ts:225`)
- `worker:heartbeat` — emitted by `handleHeartbeat` on success (`src/infrastructure/server/handlers/monitoring/health.ts:68-73`)

## Data Models

`Worker` (`worker.ts:11`) — full definition in [data-model](../data-model.md):

```typescript
interface Worker {
  id: WorkerId;
  name: string;
  queues: string[];
  concurrency: number;
  hostname: string; // 'unknown' if not provided
  pid: number; // 0 if not provided
  registeredAt: number; // opts.startedAt ?? Date.now()
  lastSeen: number; // refreshed on heartbeat/increment/complete/fail
  activeJobs: number;
  processedJobs: number;
  failedJobs: number;
  currentJob: string | null;
  clientId: string | null; // TCP client ID, for disconnect cleanup
}
```

`CreateWorkerOptions` (`worker.ts:29`): `{ workerId?, hostname?, pid?, startedAt?, clientId? }`.

The `ListWorkers` response adds derived fields not stored on `Worker`:
`status: 'active' | 'stale'` (computed from `lastSeen`,
`src/infrastructure/server/handlers/monitoring/workers.ts:12-13`) and `uptime: now - registeredAt`
(`src/infrastructure/server/handlers/monitoring/workers.ts:79-86`). The `RegisterWorker` response includes a
hardcoded `status: 'active'` and no `uptime` (`src/infrastructure/server/handlers/monitoring/workers.ts:33-50`).

## Business Logic / Control Flow

### Register / re-register (`register`, `workerManager.ts:42`)

1. If `opts.workerId` is supplied **and** already present, the existing record
   is updated in place: `queues`, `concurrency`, `lastSeen`, and optionally
   `hostname`/`pid` are overwritten, then the existing `Worker` is returned
   (`workerManager.ts:49-58`). This makes re-registration idempotent on a known
   ID — counters (`processedJobs`, etc.) are preserved.
2. Otherwise `createWorker()` mints a record (generating a UUID if no `workerId`)
   and inserts it (`workerManager.ts:60-62`).

`QueueManager.registerWorker` wraps this and emits `worker:connected`; the TCP
handler injects the connection's `clientId` so disconnect cleanup can find it
(`src/infrastructure/server/handlers/monitoring/workers.ts:21-31`).

### Heartbeat (`heartbeat`, `workerManager.ts:95`)

1. Returns `false` if the worker is unknown (`handleHeartbeat` then replies
   `Worker not found`, `src/infrastructure/server/handlers/monitoring/health.ts:68-73`).
2. Refreshes `lastSeen = Date.now()`.
3. If `stats` are provided, each of `activeJobs` / `processed` / `failed` is
   treated as an **absolute** value: the manager subtracts the old per-worker
   value from the aggregate counter and adds the new one, keeping the global
   counters consistent (`workerManager.ts:102-118`).

For a PostgreSQL-backed TCP manager, `heartbeatWorkerDurable` first fences the
row by both `broker_id` and the connection-derived `client_id`. The generic
`Worker not found` response intentionally does not disclose whether the ID
exists under another owner. Once the durable write succeeds, the owning
broker's in-memory registry is updated with the same absolute statistics.

### Per-job counter mutators

- `incrementActive` (`workerManager.ts:123`): `activeJobs++`, aggregate++, set
  `currentJob`, refresh `lastSeen`.
- `jobCompleted` (`workerManager.ts:136`): decrement `activeJobs` (guarded at 0),
  `processedJobs++`, refresh `lastSeen`, and emit `worker:idle` when no jobs
  remain.
- `jobFailed` (`workerManager.ts:154`): same shape but bumps `failedJobs` and,
  on crossing failure thresholds, emits `worker:error` with a rounded
  `failureRate`.

> **Note:** in the current codebase these three mutators are not invoked on the
> live server pull/ack/fail path (only `register`, `heartbeat`,
> `unregister*`, and the read methods are). Per-worker `activeJobs`/`processed`/
> `failed` are therefore populated by client-reported `Heartbeat` stats; the
> mutators are exercised by benchmarks/embedded callers. Treat the per-worker
> counters as advisory observability data, not an authoritative ledger.

### Liveness & stale reaping

- A worker is "active" when `now - lastSeen < WORKER_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 30s).
  `listActive`, `getForQueue`, `getStats.active`, `computeWorkerStatus` and the
  dashboard/snapshot/HTTP worker views all use this window through
  `workerTimeoutMs()` (`workerManager.ts:194-206,240`;
  `src/infrastructure/server/handlers/monitoring/workers.ts:23`).
- The cleanup interval (`safeInterval`) runs every `WORKER_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_MS`
  (default 60s, `workerManager.ts:210`) and removes workers whose `lastSeen` is
  older than `WORKER_TIMEOUT_MS * 3` (90s by default, `workerManager.ts:219`) —
  i.e. a worker can read as "stale" for up to ~60s before being physically
  reaped, giving a flapping connection time to recover. A period above
  2^31 - 1 ms is honoured, never shortened to a 1 ms spin.

### `skipIfNoWorker` integration

At startup `QueueManagerState` wires the cron worker check
(`queue-manager/state.ts`):

```typescript
this.cronScheduler.setWorkerCheckCallback(
  (queue) => this.workerManager.getForQueue(queue).length > 0
);
```

When a cron with `skipIfNoWorker: true` fires, `fireCronJob` calls this
callback and, if no active worker serves the queue, skips the run and emits
`cron:skipped` with `reason: 'no-worker'`
(`src/infrastructure/scheduler/cron/execution.ts:110-117`). Because
`getForQueue` filters on the `WORKER_TIMEOUT_MS` window, a worker that stopped
heartbeating is treated as absent even before it is reaped. See
[Scheduler & Cron](./scheduler-and-cron.md).

The Bun client `Worker.run()` registers in the selected runtime. Embedded mode
calls `QueueManager.registerWorker`; TCP mode sends `RegisterWorker` and
re-registers after a pooled reconnect. A separate worker-level heartbeat keeps
`activeJobs`, processed, failed, and liveness data current. `close()` unregisters
before releasing the runtime/transport, including the embedded path.

### Disconnect cleanup

The TCP and HTTP servers call `QueueManager.unregisterWorkersByClientId` when a
connection closes (`src/infrastructure/server/tcp/connections.ts:87-103`, `server/http.ts:237-243`,
`server/sseHandler.ts:255-260`), which delegates to
`unregisterByClientId(clientId)` — removing every worker registered over that
connection and emitting `worker:disconnected` per removal
(`workerManager.ts:76-87`). Because pooled clients get a fresh server-side
`clientId` on reconnect, the client `Worker` re-sends `RegisterWorker` from its
runtime reconnect callback to stay visible (`client/worker/runtime/state.ts`).

## Concurrency & Locking

No locks. `WorkerManager` is plain synchronous mutation of a `Map` and integer
counters; it is not part of the shard lock hierarchy
([Concurrency & Locking](./concurrency-and-locking.md)). It runs on Bun's single
JS thread, so handler calls, the cleanup `setInterval`, and counter math never
interleave mid-method. There is no lease/renewal logic here — lock leasing and
renewal live in the job subsystem (`renewJobLock`), reached via `JobHeartbeat`.

## Edge Cases & Failure Modes

- **Idempotent re-registration:** re-registering a known `workerId` updates in
  place and preserves counters; an unknown/absent `workerId` creates a new
  record (`workerManager.ts:48-61`).
- **Heartbeat on unknown worker:** returns `false`; the `Heartbeat` handler then
  responds `Worker not found` (`src/infrastructure/server/handlers/monitoring/health.ts:68-73`). A client that was
  reaped must re-register.
- **Counter underflow guard:** `jobCompleted`/`jobFailed` only decrement
  `activeJobs` when `> 0` (`workerManager.ts:138,156`). However, the aggregate
  `totalActiveJobsCounter` can still drift if `heartbeat` stats and the mutators
  are mixed, or if `unregister`/`unregisterByClientId` subtract a stale
  `activeJobs` value — these counters are best-effort.
- **Memory bound:** unlike the LRU-bounded collections in
  [Core Queue Engine](./core-queue-engine.md), `workers` has **no fixed cap**.
  Its size is bounded only by the stale-reaper (`WORKER_TIMEOUT_MS * 3`). A flood
  of distinct `workerId`s heartbeating faster than the timeout could grow the
  map; in normal operation it tracks one record per live consumer connection.
- **`getStats` cost:** `total`/counters are O(1), but `active` requires an O(n)
  pass over the map (time-based, can't be cached, `workerManager.ts:240`).
- **Stale-but-not-reaped window:** between `WORKER_TIMEOUT_MS` and the reaper
  cutoff a worker reports `status: 'stale'` and is excluded from `listActive` /
  `getForQueue`, but still counts toward `getStats.total` and appears in `list`.
- **SQLite restart:** a memory/SQLite server restart drops the registry; clients
  re-register automatically on reconnect. PostgreSQL retains registrations but
  filters/purges them by shared heartbeat freshness, and graceful broker/client
  shutdown removes the rows it owns.
- **Cleanup leak on shutdown:** `stop()` must be called to clear the interval;
  `QueueManager.shutdown` calls `workerManager.stop()` (`queue-manager/lifecycle.ts`).
- **Malformed env value:** both variables must be whole milliseconds >= 1 (digits
  only; an empty value keeps the default). `abc`, `-1`, `0`, `1e12` or `60s` throws
  `Invalid WORKER_TIMEOUT_MS: "1e12" (expected a whole number of milliseconds >= 1)`
  when the QueueManager is constructed, so the server exits at startup and the
  first embedded `Queue`/`Worker` throws. Before, such values were read with
  `parseInt`: the sweep spun about every millisecond (`-1`, `0`, `abc`, an empty
  value, or anything above 2^31 - 1) or every worker read as stale (`1e12` as 1,
  `abc` as NaN).

## Configuration

| Env var                      | Default | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `WORKER_TIMEOUT_MS`          | `30000` | Liveness window: a worker is "active"/"stale" relative to `lastSeen`. Whole ms >= 1; read by `workerTimeoutMs()` for the WorkerManager and every server worker view. The config file's `timeouts.worker` is ignored (with a warning). |
| `WORKER_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_MS` | `60000` | How often `cleanupStale` runs. Whole ms >= 1; values above 2^31 - 1 are honoured (`safeInterval`). Read by `workerCleanupIntervalMs()`.                                                                                               |

The stale-removal threshold is derived, not configurable directly:
`WORKER_TIMEOUT_MS * 3` (`workerManager.ts:219`). Both variables are parsed when
the first QueueManager is constructed and cached for the process; a malformed
value fails that construction (see Edge Cases). A server validates both earlier,
in `resolveServerConfig`, so the error is a configuration error printed as one
`Fatal error:` line, before storage opens.
