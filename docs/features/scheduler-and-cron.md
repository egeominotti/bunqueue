# Scheduler & Cron

> **Category:** Scheduling · **Source:** `src/infrastructure/scheduler/cron/`, `src/infrastructure/scheduler/cronParser.ts`, `src/domain/types/cron.ts`, `src/client/queue/scheduler.ts`, `src/client/queue/schedulerPagination.ts`

## Purpose

The scheduler is the server-side engine that owns recurring/repeatable jobs ("crons"). Given either a 5–6 field cron expression (with optional IANA timezone) or a fixed millisecond interval (`repeatEvery`), it computes each job's next run time and pushes a fresh job onto the target queue when it falls due. The memory/SQLite engine is event-driven through `CronScheduler` and persists execution count/next run to SQLite. PostgreSQL multi-broker mode instead locks due `bunqueue_crons` rows, uses database time, and commits job admission plus slot advancement atomically in one transaction. The matching client surface (`upsertJobScheduler`, `every`, `cron`) is unchanged across server backends.

## Responsibilities & Scope

Owns:

- In-memory cron registry keyed by name, ordered by `nextRun` via a min-heap for
  `O(k log n)` ticks (`infrastructure/scheduler/cron/runtime.ts:22-25`).
- Cron expression validation, shortcut expansion, and next-run computation
  (delegated to `cronParser.ts`, which wraps `Bun.cron.parse()` and preserves
  the documented leading-seconds field).
- Firing due crons: limit checks, overlap/`skipIfNoWorker`/`preventOverlap`
  gating, and the push callback that creates each spawned job
  (`infrastructure/scheduler/cron/execution.ts:9-140`).
- In memory/SQLite mode, persisting cron state before pushing (executions +
  `nextRun`) so a retry does not enqueue the same slot twice
  (`infrastructure/scheduler/cron/execution.ts:69-90`). PostgreSQL instead
  admits the job and advances the locked row inside one atomic transaction.
- Restart recovery: recalculating past `nextRun` values forward and
  (optionally) skipping missed runs
  (`infrastructure/scheduler/cron/runtime.ts:126-144`).
- The client-side scheduler operations and name-prefixing for namespaced queues (`scheduler.ts`).

Does NOT own (delegated elsewhere):

- The actual job push / enqueue mechanics — done via the `PushJobCallback` wired to `QueueManager.push` ([Job Lifecycle](./job-lifecycle.md), [Core Queue Engine](./core-queue-engine.md)).
- SQLite reads/writes — the scheduler only invokes callbacks; the `cron_jobs` table, statements, and migrations live in [Persistence](./persistence.md).
- **Delayed-job promotion** (a delayed one-off job becoming `waiting` when its `run_at` arrives). This is NOT handled here; it is a property of the `PriorityQueue` ordering by `runAt` and the push/dependency paths, not the cron scheduler. See [Data Structures](./data-structures.md) and [Job Lifecycle](./job-lifecycle.md).
- Deduplication / unique-key enforcement on spawned jobs — the scheduler only supplies the `uniqueKey`/`dedup` fields; enforcement is in [Deduplication & Unique Jobs](./deduplication-and-unique.md).
- Worker registration that `skipIfNoWorker` consults — see [Worker Registry & Management](./workers-management.md).

## Dependencies

Internal:

- `src/domain/types/cron.ts` — `CronJob`, `CronJobInput`, `CronJobOptions`, `CronDedup`, `createCronJob`, `isAtLimit`.
- `src/infrastructure/scheduler/cronParser.ts` — `validateCronExpression`, `getNextCronRun`, `getNextIntervalRun`, `expandCronShortcut` (+ unused-by-scheduler helpers `isDue`, `describeCron`).
- `src/shared/minHeap.ts` — `MinHeap` for the next-run-ordered heap.
- `src/shared/logger.ts` — `cronLog`.
- `QueueManager` wires push, persistence, and worker-presence callbacks in
  `application/queue-manager/state.ts`; dashboard wiring and the public cron
  methods live in `application/queue-manager/services.ts`.
- `src/client/manager.ts` (`getSharedManager`) and `src/client/tcpPool.ts` for the embedded vs TCP split in `scheduler.ts`.
- `src/client/queue/schedulerPagination.ts` provides the shared deterministic
  ordering and inclusive range operation for embedded and TCP listings.

External / runtime:

- **Bun `cron`** — the native parser owns the five calendar fields, timezone,
  POSIX day matching, and DST behavior. The local adapter parses only the
  optional leading seconds field; this module has no third-party dependency.
- Bun/Node timers: `setTimeout` (precise wake) + `setInterval` (60s safety fallback).
- SQLite via the persistence layer (indirect, through callbacks).

## Public Interface

### Server-side class — `CronScheduler` (`cronScheduler.ts:10`)

`CronScheduler` is the public façade over `CronExecution` and `CronRuntime`;
the callbacks and registry methods below live in `cron/runtime.ts`, while
`tick`, `fireCronJob`, and `getStats` live in `cron/execution.ts`. Callback
types are isolated in `types/cronScheduler.ts`.

```typescript
class CronScheduler {
  constructor(_config?: CronSchedulerConfig); // config kept for back-compat, unused
  setPushCallback(callback: PushJobCallback): void;
  setPersistCallback(callback: PersistCronCallback): void;
  setWorkerCheckCallback(callback: (queue: string) => boolean): void;
  setDashboardEmit(callback: (event: string, data: Record<string, unknown>) => void): void;
  start(): void;
  stop(): void;
  add(input: CronJobInput): CronJob; // also performs upsert
  remove(name: string): boolean; // O(1) lazy deletion
  get(name: string): CronJob | undefined;
  list(): CronJob[];
  load(crons: CronJob[]): void; // restart recovery
  getStats(): { total: number; pending: number; nextRun: number | null };
}

type PushJobCallback = (queue: string, input: JobInput) => Promise<void>;
type PersistCronCallback = (name: string, executions: number, nextRun: number) => void;
```

The `QueueManager` re-exposes these as `addCron(input)`, `removeCron(name)`,
`getCron(name)`, and `listCrons()` (`application/queue-manager/services.ts`).

### Parser functions (`cronParser.ts`)

```typescript
validateCronExpression(expression: string, timezone?: string): string | null; // null = valid
getNextCronRun(expression: string, fromTime?: number, timezone?: string): number; // ms epoch
getNextIntervalRun(intervalMs: number, lastRun?: number): number;                 // lastRun + intervalMs
expandCronShortcut(expression: string): string; // @daily, @hourly, ...
describeCron(expression: string): string;        // human-readable; preserves optional seconds field
```

`CRON_SHORTCUTS` (`cronParser.ts:170-178`): `@yearly`/`@annually` → `0 0 1 1 *`, `@monthly` → `0 0 1 * *`, `@weekly` → `0 0 * * 0`, `@daily`/`@midnight` → `0 0 * * *`, `@hourly` → `0 * * * *`.

The public grammar is Bun's five-field POSIX syntax plus an optional leading
seconds field (`0-59`, with `*`, lists, ranges, and steps). Seven-field years
and the non-POSIX `L`, `W`, `#`, `+`, and `?` extensions are rejected. A next
run is always strictly later than the supplied cursor; an expression with no
future occurrence is invalid rather than being stored with `nextRun = 0`.

Persisted definitions are validated as a complete collection before scheduler
state, missed-run timestamps, recovery state, or PostgreSQL broker registration
is mutated. A Croner-only definition left by a pre-2.9 installation blocks
startup with its escaped name and schedule and directs the operator to update
or remove it while running 2.8. SQLite closes the database when persisted cron
reading or validation fails during synchronous construction; PostgreSQL
performs the namespace scan before registering the broker or starting
maintenance. This fail-closed migration boundary avoids both partial
reconciliation and a zero-delay retry loop for a due invalid row.

### Client SDK (`scheduler.ts`, surfaced on `Queue`)

```typescript
Queue.upsertJobScheduler(schedulerId: string, repeatOpts: RepeatOpts, jobTemplate?: JobTemplate<T>): Promise<SchedulerInfo | null>;
Queue.removeJobScheduler(schedulerId: string): Promise<boolean>;
Queue.getJobScheduler(schedulerId: string): Promise<SchedulerInfo | null>;
Queue.getJobSchedulers(start?, end?, asc?): Promise<SchedulerInfo[]>;
Queue.getJobSchedulersCount(): Promise<number>;
```

`RepeatOpts` (`scheduler.ts:40-55`): `pattern?`, `every?`, `limit?`, `immediately?`, `count?`, `prevMillis?`, `offset?`, `jobId?`, `timezone?`, `skipMissedOnRestart?`, `skipIfNoWorker?`, `preventOverlap?`. `limit` is forwarded to the cron definition as `maxLimit` (the run cap; see #111) and echoed back on `SchedulerInfo.limit`. (`count`, `prevMillis`, `offset`, `jobId` are still accepted for BullMQ shape compatibility but have no cron-side equivalent, so they are not forwarded.)

`getJobSchedulers` orders definitions by their next execution time. `start` and
`end` are zero-based inclusive offsets (`end: -1` means the end of the list),
and `asc` defaults to `false`, matching BullMQ. Equal execution times use the
scheduler ID as a deterministic tie-breaker in the requested direction. The
same client-side range operation is applied to embedded and TCP results.

### Simple-mode helpers (`src/client/bunqueue.ts:58-90`)

```typescript
Bunqueue.cron(id, pattern, data?, opts?: { timezone?; limit?; jobOpts? }): Promise<SchedulerInfo | null>;
Bunqueue.every(id, intervalMs, data?, opts?: { limit?; jobOpts? }): Promise<SchedulerInfo | null>;
Bunqueue.removeCron(id); Bunqueue.listCrons();
```

Both delegate to `Queue.upsertJobScheduler` — `cron` sets `pattern`, `every` sets the `every` interval.

### Completion-chained repeats (`Queue.add`)

`Queue.add(..., { repeat })` creates a completion-chained repeat rather than a
named `CronJob`. The directly added generation runs normally; after each
successful completion, `repeatJobs.ts` calculates one future deadline with the
same native parser adapter and shortcut expansion used by `CronScheduler`. Pattern
chains respect `tz`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `offset`, `prevMillis`, `limit`,
`immediately`, and `repeat.jobId`. Interval chains skip elapsed slots instead of
creating a catch-up loop. `limit: N` retains the established contract of the
initial generation plus at most N successors.

`offset` shifts the cron tick itself: the parser is queried from
`now - offset` (and `prevMillis - offset` for later generations), so a positive
offset does not skip a base tick whose shifted deadline is still future and a
negative offset cannot turn the next deadline into an immediate/past run.
Interval repeats apply the offset to the first successor only, advance by whole
`every` slots when that deadline has elapsed, and then remain anchored to
`prevMillis`; `immediately` never makes every successor immediate.

The successor copies retry, timeout, retention, stall, logging, size, priority,
group, failure-policy, deduplication, debounce, and durable-write settings while
resetting execution-owned fields such as attempts, progress, timeline, and the
generation timestamp. `updateData()` on a completed generation follows the
repeat-chain link to the pending successor. Parent/dependency relationships and
outer `JobOptions.jobId` are rejected before insertion because reusing those
identities across independent generations is ambiguous; `repeat.jobId` remains
the compatible repeat metadata field.

SQLite `jobs.extended_options` persists the repeat definition, object backoff,
advanced options, dedup/debounce policy, and durable flag. A delayed successor
therefore recovers with the same policy and can continue the chain after a
broker restart.

### TCP commands handled

- `Cron` — create/upsert a cron (`handlers/cron.ts:13-65`, routed at `handler-routes/control.ts:93-106`).
- `CronGet` — fetch one cron by name (`handlers/cron.ts:68-92`).
- `CronDelete` — remove a cron (`handlers/cron.ts:95-103`).
- `CronList` — list all crons (`handlers/cron.ts:106-127`).

Command shapes in `src/domain/types/commands/cron.ts:4-33`.

### HTTP / CLI / MCP

- HTTP cron routes proxy to the same handlers (`httpRouteResources.ts:31-82`:
  `CronList`, `Cron`, `CronGet`, `CronDelete`).
- In PostgreSQL mode, TCP/HTTP `DashboardOverview` and the periodic
  WebSocket/SSE stats snapshot read `listCronsDurable()`, so a schedule created
  through broker A is visible immediately from broker B even before its local
  compatibility snapshot catches up. Memory/SQLite keeps the synchronous local
  scheduler list.
- CLI: `bunqueue cron list | add | delete` (`cli/commands/cron.ts`). `add` requires `--queue` + `--data` and one of `--schedule`/`--every`; rejects `--every <= 0` and `--max-limit < 0` (`cron.ts:55-89`).
- MCP tools `bunqueue_add_cron` / `bunqueue_list_crons` /
  `bunqueue_get_cron` / `bunqueue_delete_cron` (`mcp/tools/cronTools.ts`).

### Dashboard events emitted (via `setDashboardEmit`)

`cron:created`, `cron:updated`, `cron:deleted` (from the TCP handler),
`cron:fired`, `cron:skipped` (reason `no-worker` or `overlap`), and
`cron:missed` (persist or push failure, or a non-finite `nextRun` rescheduled by
`repairNextRun`, with an `error` naming the old value and the new slot) —
`infrastructure/scheduler/cron/execution.ts:47-101,120-140` and
`handlers/cron.ts:39-45,95-102`.

## Data Models

Canonical definition is `CronJob` (`src/domain/types/cron.ts:31-56`). See [data-model](../data-model.md) for the full schema. Most relevant fields:

| Field                    | Type                           | Notes                                                                                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`                   | `string`                       | PRIMARY KEY in `cron_jobs`; global, so multi-prefix queues must namespace (see Concurrency). |
| `jobName`                | `string`                       | Name assigned to every spawned Job; stored separately from user `data`.                      |
| `queue`                  | `string`                       | target queue for spawned jobs.                                                               |
| `schedule`               | `string \| null`               | cron expression; when both timing fields are valid, this takes precedence.                   |
| `repeatEvery`            | `number \| null`               | fixed interval in ms; a positive safe integer when provided.                                  |
| `priority`               | `number`                       | spawned-job priority (default `0`).                                                          |
| `timezone`               | `string \| null`               | IANA tz for `schedule`.                                                                      |
| `nextRun` / `executions` | `number`                       | mutable runtime state, persisted.                                                            |
| `maxLimit`               | `number \| null`               | `null`/0/negative ⇒ unlimited (`cron.ts:122-124`).                                           |
| `uniqueKey` / `dedup`    | dedup config for spawned jobs. |
| `skipMissedOnRestart`    | `boolean`                      | **default `true`** in `createCronJob` (`cron.ts:127`).                                       |
| `skipIfNoWorker`         | `boolean`                      | default `false`.                                                                             |
| `preventOverlap`         | `boolean`                      | default `true`.                                                                              |
| `jobOptions`             | `CronJobOptions \| null`       | per-cron retry/cleanup policy (issue #86).                                                   |

`CronJobOptions` (`cron.ts:20-28`): `maxAttempts`, `backoff`, `timeout`, `delay`,
`stallTimeout`, `removeOnComplete`, `removeOnFail`. `SchedulerInfo`
(`scheduler.ts:64-72`): `{ id, name, next, pattern?, every?, limit? }`
(`limit` = the persisted `maxLimit` run cap, `undefined` when unlimited; #111).
The `cron_jobs` SQLite table is defined at `schema.ts:125-144`; migrations 6,
8-10, 12, and 32 added deduplication, skip/overlap policy, job options, and the
first-class spawned-job name.

## Business Logic / Control Flow

### Add / upsert (`add`, `cron/runtime.ts:79-107`)

1. Before orphan cleanup or state/storage mutation (`assertValidCronInput`,
   `cron/validation.ts`), reject a supplied `repeatEvery` unless it is a positive
   safe integer of at most `MAX_JOB_DURATION_MS` (4,320,000,000,000,000 ms, which
   keeps every nextRun a valid date); reject if neither timing field is set; validate
   the spawned-job options with the PUSH rules (`validateJobOptions`, see
   [Job Options Validation](./job-options-validation.md)), which refuse only what no
   job can run with, so every template 2.9.10 stored and ran is accepted:
   `priority`, `dedup.ttl`, and the applied template fields `maxAttempts`,
   `backoff`, `timeout`, `delay`, `stallTimeout`, reported with a `jobOptions.`
   prefix (`jobOptions.timeout must be a finite number`; a negative template `delay`
   is accepted and each spawned job treats it as 0, a `backoff` object without `delay`
   uses the 1000 ms default base); and validate the
   expanded calendar expression plus IANA timezone. For compatibility, a valid
   `schedule` takes precedence when both fields are supplied. Unknown template
   keys stay ignored. Persisted definitions are not re-validated against the
   option bounds on load, so an older invalid template does not block startup:
   `assertPersistedCronsSupported` (`cron/persisted.ts`) logs one warning per such
   definition at load, through the same `cronTemplateError` check `addCron` uses,
   naming the cron and the problem (`Persisted cron "<name>" has an invalid job
   template: <problem>. It still runs with its stored values; ...`). The SQLite
   pre-check and the runtime load share one report per definition.
2. The runtime reuses the same centralized validation before its own map/heap
   mutation.
3. Compute `nextRun` via `getNextCronRun` (cron) or `getNextIntervalRun` (interval) from `now`.
4. `createCronJob` builds the immutable record. If a cron with the same name
   exists, **preserve its `executions`** and clear `lastFiredAt` for that name
   (`cron/runtime.ts:94-99`, fixes H10).
5. `immediately` sets `nextRun = now` **only on first creation**, never on
   upsert (so it doesn't clobber restart-skip logic) (`cron/runtime.ts:100`).
6. Assign a fresh `generation`, store in map + heap, then `scheduleNext()`.

At the manager layer, `addCron` first removes an orphaned queued job when
`preventOverlap` is set, so a stale job from a disconnect window is not
immediately consumed by the new worker (`application/queue-manager/services.ts`,
#73). It then persists via `storage.saveCron`.

### Event-driven wake (`scheduleNext`, `runtime.ts`)

Clears the current timer, pops stale heap entries (generation mismatch), then
arms one `setTimeout` for the soonest live cron. Runtime timers cannot represent
delays above `2_147_483_647ms`, so a farther `nextRun` is reached through bounded
timer chunks (`clampTimerDelay`, [Shared Timers](./shared-timers.md)). Each
intermediate wake runs the normal due-time guard and rearms from the unchanged
absolute `nextRun`; it does not persist, increment, or push.
This prevents Bun from coercing a far-future timer to `1ms` and hot-looping.
The timer is rearmed after every mutation (add/remove/load/tick).

### Tick / fire (`tick`, `cron/execution.ts:9-108`)

1. Drain heap entries whose `nextRun <= now` (`O(k log n)`).
2. Skip stale entries (generation mismatch from a removed/updated cron).
3. If `isAtLimit`, mark for removal from the map and drop.
4. **Compute `newExecutions` and `newNextRun` before pushing.** Interval crons anchor `newNextRun` to the _scheduled_ slot, not wall-clock now, so a slow job does not cumulatively drift the schedule (M4).
5. **Skip gating BEFORE the budget increment** (`getSkipReason`): `skipIfNoWorker` (no workers registered for the queue → reason `no-worker`) and overlap detection (last fire for this name within `interval * 0.8`, `interval = repeatEvery ?? 60000` → reason `overlap`). A skipped fire advances `nextRun` (persist best-effort, in-memory always) and emits `cron:skipped`, but does **not** touch `executions`: skips never consume the `maxLimit` budget. Before this ordering, a `skipIfNoWorker` cron with no worker burned its entire budget with zero deliveries. Corollary: a `skipIfNoWorker` cron with a `maxLimit` whose queue never gets a worker defers forever — it never increments, never reaches its cap, and never self-removes; it keeps waking the scheduler once per interval until a worker appears or the cron is deleted.
6. **Persist state first** (`persistCron` with `newExecutions`). If persist throws: emit `cron:missed`, do **not** push, re-insert to retry next tick.
7. Update in-memory `executions`/`nextRun`, then `fireCronJob`. If the push throws: state was already persisted, the job for this slot is lost, emit `cron:missed`, re-insert to continue (no duplicate on retry).
8. Re-insert processed entries, delete limit-reached names, `scheduleNext()`.

### Fire (`fireCronJob`, `cron/execution.ts:120-140`)

- Skip decisions live in `getSkipReason` (see tick step 5), not here: by the time `fireCronJob` runs the push is committed.
- **`preventOverlap`**: when no explicit `uniqueKey`, auto-derives `cron:<name>` so the dedup layer blocks a new push while the prior job is still active.
- Push with `data`, `priority`, `uniqueKey`, `dedup`, and the `jobOptions` subset; record `lastFiredAt`; emit `cron:fired`.

### Restart recovery (`load`, `cron/runtime.ts:126-144`)

For each loaded cron, if (`skipMissedOnRestart || skipIfNoWorker`) and `nextRun < now`, recompute `nextRun` forward and persist it (fixes #73). Since `skipMissedOnRestart` defaults to `true`, missed runs are skipped by default. Heap is rebuilt with `buildFrom` in `O(n)`.

In PostgreSQL mode, startup reconciliation runs only when the namespace has no
other active broker. It collapses an overdue skipped schedule to its next future
slot, preventing a newly added broker from consuming another broker's schedule.
Due rows are locked with `SKIP LOCKED`; `skipIfNoWorker` reads the shared worker
table, and expired/shutdown `preventOverlap` generations are discarded instead
of requeued. See
[PostgreSQL 15–18 Multi-Broker Persistence](./postgres-multibroker.md).

### Client upsert mapping (`upsertJobScheduler`, `scheduler.ts`)

Builds cron `data` from the template (`buildCronData`), merges queue `defaultJobOptions` under per-scheduler `opts` into `CronJobOptions` (`buildCronJobOptions`, issue #86), extracts dedup from `opts.deduplication`, derives spawned-job `priority` from `opts.priority`/queue default (carried on the top-level field the handler reads), and namespaces the id via `toCronName`. Embedded mode calls `manager.addCron` (timezone defaults to `'UTC'`); TCP mode sends the `Cron` command. An invalid schedule or template throws the same message in both modes: embedded from `addCron`, TCP from the broker's `{ ok: false, error }` (it used to return `null`). The template helpers live in `schedulerTemplate.ts`. `removeJobScheduler`/`getJobScheduler(s)` mirror this over `CronDelete`/`CronList`.
The immediate upsert result preserves the scheduler's normalized `pattern` or
`every` field and exact `nextRun`. Embedded mode uses the `CronJob` returned by
`manager.addCron`; TCP uses the broker's nested `cron` response. Both therefore
match a subsequent `getJobScheduler()` read without approximating pattern
schedules as 60-second intervals.

## Concurrency & Locking

- The scheduler holds **no shard/jobIndex locks**; it runs on the single JS event loop and mutates only its own `Map`/`MinHeap`. Concurrency safety comes from the single-threaded tick.
- **Lazy deletion via generation numbers**: `remove`/upsert just bumps the map;
  stale heap entries are detected by generation mismatch and skipped/popped in
  `scheduleNext`/`tick`, giving `O(1)` removal without heap rebuilds
  (`cron/runtime.ts:95-115,146-168`, `cron/execution.ts:16-22`).
- **Persist-before-push ordering** is the cross-process invariant: persisting
  `nextRun`/`executions` before enqueuing means a crash between the two yields
  at most a lost job for that slot, never a duplicate
  (`cron/execution.ts:69-90`).
- Cron names are a **global PRIMARY KEY** (`schema.ts:104`). The client prefixes scheduler ids with `prefixKey` so two queues with different prefixes cannot collide (`scheduler.ts:21-37`).
- `preventOverlap`/overlap-window guard against concurrent in-flight runs of the same cron across workers; enforcement is via uniqueKey dedup in the push path.

## Edge Cases & Failure Modes

- **Persist failure** → job not pushed, `cron:missed` emitted, retried next tick (no duplicate).
- **Push failure** → state already persisted, slot's job lost, `cron:missed` emitted, scheduling continues.
- **`maxLimit` exhaustion** → cron removed from the in-memory map on the tick that would exceed it (`isAtLimit`); `0`/negative limits are normalized to "unlimited" everywhere (`cron.ts:97-99`, `cli/commands/cron.ts:81-89`).
- **Timer drift / missed `setTimeout`** → the 60s `SAFETY_FALLBACK_MS` interval
  re-runs `tick` as a backstop (`cron/runtime.ts:17-18,58-65`).
- **Far-future timer** → delays above the runtime's signed 32-bit timer ceiling
  are chunked without changing the persisted absolute `nextRun`; no early
  execution or 1ms hot loop occurs.
- **Non-finite `nextRun`** (a corrupted persisted row, or `NaN`/`null`/`±Infinity`
  written into a scheduled cron) → `repairNextRun` (`cron/runtime.ts`) reschedules
  it from now, as a restart with `skipMissedOnRestart` does, persists the new slot,
  logs a warning and emits `cron:missed`; the corrupted slot is not fired. `load()`
  repairs before building the heap (a non-finite key breaks the heap order), and
  `scheduleNext`/`tick` repair an entry that reaches the top, so arming never sees
  `NaN` (`clampTimerDelay` would throw) and an interval cron cannot stay `NaN`
  (`NaN + repeatEvery`). An entry whose next run cannot be recomputed is logged and
  left out of the heap; it stays listed until updated
  (`test/repro-cron-nan-next-run.test.ts`).
- **Overlap from slow jobs** → suppressed via the `interval * 0.8` window and `preventOverlap` uniqueKey; interval-rate crons anchor to the scheduled slot to avoid drift.
- **DST spring-forward** → a fixed local time in the missing hour shifts forward
  by the gap; for a multi-minute pattern inside the gap, Bun fires only the first
  missing match after the jump.
- **DST fall-back** → a fixed local time in the repeated hour fires once at its
  first occurrence, while a pattern whose minute or hour is `*` traverses both
  occurrences. The six-field adapter preserves the requested seconds on the
  minute selected by Bun. This intentionally differs from Croner wildcard
  traversal and is locked by `test/cron-native-dst-semantics.test.ts`.
- **Invalid `repeatEvery`** → every public backend and persisted-row preflight
  rejects non-numeric, non-finite, non-integer, unsafe, zero, or negative intervals before mutation. This
  prevents past-due or zero-delay hot loops and unusable persisted definitions.
- **Restart with past `nextRun`** → recalculated forward; missed runs skipped by default (`skipMissedOnRestart` default `true`).
- **Upsert preserves `executions`** and resets `lastFiredAt` (H10) so a redefined cron isn't blocked by the prior definition's last fire.
- **#103 (fixed 2.8.14)**: with `skipIfNoWorker: true`, after a TCP reconnect the cron silently stops firing if the worker is not re-registered — `fireCronJob` sees no worker and emits `cron:skipped` instead of pushing. The fix re-registers workers on reconnect; `Worker.resume()` alone does not recover it. Upgrade clients to ≥ 2.8.14.
- **No-storage mode**: with no `storage` wired, `persistCron` is null and crons
  are purely in-memory (lost on restart) — the persist guard is skipped
  (`cron/execution.ts:69-85`).

## Configuration

- `CronSchedulerConfig.checkIntervalMs` — **deprecated/no-op**; the scheduler
  uses precise `setTimeout` (`types/cronScheduler.ts:4-7`,
  `cron/runtime.ts:38-40,146-168`).
- `SAFETY_FALLBACK_MS = 60_000` — internal constant, not env-configurable.
- `MAX_TIMER_DELAY_MS = 2_147_483_647` — the runtime timer ceiling, shared from
  `src/shared/timers.ts` ([Shared Timers](./shared-timers.md)) and applied through
  `clampTimerDelay`; not env-configurable, and it does not cap cron intervals or
  persisted timestamps.
- Per-cron knobs (via `CronJobInput`/`RepeatOpts`): `schedule`/`repeatEvery`, `timezone` (embedded default `'UTC'`), `priority`, `maxLimit`, `uniqueKey`/`dedup`, `skipMissedOnRestart` (default `true`), `skipIfNoWorker` (default `false`), `preventOverlap` (default `true`), `immediately`, and `jobOptions` (`maxAttempts`/`backoff`/`timeout`/`delay`/`stallTimeout`/`removeOnComplete`/`removeOnFail`).
- Queue-level `defaultJobOptions` feed `buildCronJobOptions` as the base,
  overridden by the per-scheduler template `opts` (`scheduler.ts:85-99`).
- Data path / persistence env vars (`BUNQUEUE_DATA_PATH`, etc.) are owned by [Configuration & Entrypoint](./configuration.md) and [Persistence](./persistence.md); this module has no dedicated env vars.
