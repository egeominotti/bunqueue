# Client SDK: Worker (& sandboxed)

> **Category:** Client SDK · **Source:** `src/client/worker/worker.ts`, `src/client/worker/runtime/`, `src/client/worker/types/`, `src/client/worker/handlers/`, `src/client/worker/processor.ts`, `src/client/worker/processorOutcome.ts`, `src/client/worker/processorResult.ts`, `src/client/worker/batchExecution.ts`, `src/client/worker/ackBatcher.ts`, `src/client/worker/ackFrontier.ts`, `src/client/worker/workerPull.ts`, `src/client/worker/workerHeartbeat.ts`, `src/client/queue-events/tcpSubscription.ts`, `src/client/sandboxed/worker.ts`, `src/client/sandboxed/runtime/`, `src/client/sandboxed/types/`, `src/client/sandboxed/wrapper.ts`, `src/client/sandboxed/queueOps.ts`

## Purpose

The Worker SDK is the consumer side of bunqueue: a BullMQ-style polling worker that pulls jobs, runs a processor, and reports the outcome to the broker. The four-line `Worker` façade inherits focused state, control, manual-processing, lifecycle, buffer, polling and execution layers under `worker/runtime/`; its contracts live under `worker/types/`. `SandboxedWorker` follows the same four-line façade pattern with state, lifecycle, pool, dispatch and recovery modules under `sandboxed/runtime/` and separate types under `sandboxed/types/`. Both embedded and TCP transports use the same public API.

## Responsibilities & Scope

Owns:

- Job pull loop, concurrency gate, batch pulling, long-poll and pull-error backoff (`runtime/polling.ts`).
- Lease accounting and buffered-job selection (`runtime/state.ts`, `runtime/buffer.ts`, `runtime/execution.ts`).
- Processor invocation, auto-ack on success, fail/retry dispatch,
  `DelayedError`/`UnrecoverableError` handling, and processor-owned terminal or
  nonterminal transitions (`processor.ts`, `processorOutcome.ts`).
- One-invocation native batch processing with per-member outcomes
  (`batchExecution.ts`), structural Observable completion (`processorResult.ts`),
  and AbortSignal cancellation for active delivery generations.
- ACK batching with backpressure, retry, and a reachable-outcome frontier
  (`ackBatcher.ts`, `ackFrontier.ts`).
- Job and worker heartbeats / lock renewal (`workerHeartbeat.ts`,
  `runtime/control.ts`, `runtime/execution.ts`).
- Worker registration/unregistration with the server, and re-registration on
  reconnect (`runtime/state.ts`, `runtime/execution.ts`, `runtime/lifecycle.ts`).
- Queue-scoped `stalled` notification delivery from the manager in embedded
  mode or a dedicated broker event subscription in TCP mode.
- Client-side rate limiting and per-group concurrency (`workerRateLimiter.ts`, `groupConcurrency.ts`).
- Graceful/forced close and buffered-job release (`runtime/lifecycle.ts`).
- Sandboxed thread lifecycle, dispatch, timeout, crash restart and idle recycle (`sandboxed/runtime/`).

Does NOT own (delegated):

- Queue state, priority ordering, persistence, stall _detection itself_, lock storage — all server/`QueueManager` side. See [Core Queue Engine](./core-queue-engine.md), [Job Lifecycle](./job-lifecycle.md), [Persistence](./persistence.md).
- The TCP wire framing and connection pool/reconnect — see [Client Transport](./client-transport.md) and [TCP Wire Protocol](./tcp-protocol.md).
- Producing jobs — see [Client SDK: Queue](./client-queue-sdk.md).
- DLQ routing on max-attempts — see [Dead Letter Queue](./dead-letter-queue.md).

## Dependencies

Internal:

- `../manager` (`getSharedManager`) — embedded `QueueManager` access. Worker construction synchronously rejects an explicit `dataPath` that differs from the process-wide manager's canonical path; an omitted path joins the active manager. See [Client SDK: Queue](./client-queue-sdk.md) and [Core Queue Engine](./core-queue-engine.md).
- `../tcpPool` (`TcpConnectionPool`, `getSharedPool`/`releaseSharedPool`) — TCP transport. See [Client Transport](./client-transport.md).
- `./processor` + `./processorHandlers` — execution and the `Job` method handlers (progress/log/state/children/mutations).
- `./ackBatcher`, `./workerPull`, `./workerHeartbeat`, `./jobParser`.
- `./workerRateLimiter`, `./groupConcurrency`. See [Rate Limiting & Concurrency](./rate-limiting-and-concurrency.md).
- `../resolveToken`, `../types` (`WorkerOptions`, `Processor`, `Job`, `RateLimiterOptions`).

External / runtime:

- Bun APIs: `Worker` (sandboxed threads), `Bun.sleep`, `Bun.file`, `Bun.env`, `Bun.gc` indirectly via `smol`.
- Node `events.EventEmitter`, `os.hostname`, `node:fs`/`node:fs/promises`/`node:path` (sandboxed wrapper file generation).

Re-exported (with a `@deprecated` alias) from `src/client/sandboxedWorker.ts`.

### Helper modules

- `processJob(internalJob, ProcessorConfig)` (`processor.ts:60`).
- `AckBatcher` (`ackBatcher.ts:25`) with `queue/flush/stop/waitForInFlight/hasPending`.
- `pullEmbedded(config, count)` / `pullTcp(config, tcp, count, closing)` (`workerPull.ts`).
- `startHeartbeat(deps, intervalMs)` / `sendHeartbeat(deps)` (`workerHeartbeat.ts`).
- `parseJobFromResponse(jobData, queueName)` (`jobParser.ts`).

### TCP commands sent (client → server)

`PULL`, `PULLB`; `ACKB` (batch ack), `FAIL`; `MoveToWait`, `MoveToDelayed`, `MoveToWaitingChildren`; `RateLimitGroup`; `JobHeartbeat`, `JobHeartbeatB`, `Heartbeat`; `RegisterWorker`, `UnregisterWorker`; `Ping`; `ExtendLock`, `ExtendLocks`; and `SubscribeEvents` on a dedicated queue-event connection (`UnsubscribeEvents` is available to raw protocol clients; Worker closes its dedicated socket). Processor `Job` handlers additionally send `Progress`, `AddLog`, `GetState`, `GetResult`, `GetChildrenValues`, `GetFailedChildrenValues`, `GetIgnoredChildrenFailures`, `RemoveChildDependency`, `RemoveJobDeduplicationKey`, `RemoveUnprocessedChildren`, `Cancel` (remove), `Update`, `Promote`, `ChangeDelay`, `ChangePriority`, `ClearLogs`, `Discard`, and for `waitUntilFinished` (the shared wait in `client/jobWait.ts`, see [Client SDK: Queue](./client-queue-sdk.md)) `GetState`, `GetResult`, `GetJob` for the failure reason, and `WaitJob` with its own command timeout. `SandboxedWorker` TCP ops also use plain `ACK` and `GetJobCounts`. See [TCP Server Command Handlers](./tcp-server-handlers.md).

### Events emitted

`Worker`: `ready`, `active(job)`, `completed(job, result)`, `failed(job,
error)`, `progress(job, n)`, `stalled(jobId, reason)` (embedded and TCP),
`error(err)`, `cancelled({jobId, reason})`,
`log(job, msg)`, `drained`, `closed` (`worker/runtime/state.ts`).
`SandboxedWorker`: `ready`, `active`, `completed`, `failed`, `progress`, `log`,
`error`, `closed` (no `drained` / `stalled` / `cancelled`)
(`sandboxed/runtime/state.ts`).

## Data Models

See [data-model](../data-model.md) for the full `Job` shape. Key types used here:

- `WorkerOptions`: `client/types/worker.ts`.
- `ExtendedWorkerOptions`: `client/worker/types/options.ts`, resolved by
  `worker/runtime/options.ts`.
- `Processor<T, R>`: `client/types/flow.ts`; processor-internal contracts:
  `client/worker/types/processor.ts`.
- `PendingAck`: `client/worker/types/transport.ts`.
- `SandboxedWorkerOptions`: `client/sandboxed/types/options.ts`.
- `WorkerProcess` and IPC requests/responses:
  `client/sandboxed/types/process.ts`.
- `jobParser` builds an `InternalJob` from a TCP response, defaulting `maxAttempts=3`, `backoff=1000`, `attempts=0`, etc. (`jobParser.ts`).
  It also reads the object-form `backoffConfig` (`{ type, delay, maxDelay? }`) that the
  server serializes with every pulled job, so `job.opts.backoff` and the
  `DelayedError` cap see `maxDelay` in TCP mode. A missing field, `null`
  (numeric backoff) or malformed object yields `null`; an unusable
  `maxDelay` is dropped through the same `parseMaxDelay` rule `createJob` uses.

## Business Logic / Control Flow

### Construction & startup

`resolveWorkerOptions` in `worker/runtime/options.ts` applies defaults:
`concurrency=1`, `autorun=true`, `heartbeatInterval=10000`,
`batchSize=min(opts,1000)` default 10, `pollTimeout=min(opts,30000)` default 0,
`useLocks=true`, `drainDelay=50`, `lockDuration=30000`,
`maxStalledCount=1`. It first calls `rejectLegacyConnectionOptions()`
(`client/legacyConnectionOptions.ts`): in TCP mode a defined top-level `host`,
`port`, `token`, or `tls` (the flat bunqueue-client 0.1.x shape, never read)
throws before any pool, timer, or subscription exists, naming the keys to move
into `connection`. `SandboxedWorker` runs the same guard unless an embedded
`manager` is injected, because without `connection` it would silently run
embedded. `worker/runtime/state.ts` owns
`queueKey = (prefixKey ?? '') + name`, transport construction, ACK-batcher
wiring, reconnect registration, and the `autorun` decision.

`batch: { size, minSize, timeout, groupAffinity }` enables native batch
processing. One processor invocation receives a leading job whose `getBatch()`
returns every leased member; `setAsFailed(error)` selectively fails one member.
Each member retains its own lease, ACK/failure transition, events, and cleanup.
`groupAffinity` never mixes group IDs in one batch. `minSize` waits indefinitely
when `timeout` is omitted and permits a partial batch after the timeout. Without
group affinity, grouped batches ignore `minSize`, matching BullMQ Pro. A Worker
limiter reserves one start per batch member only after the batch is ready;
waiting for `minSize` consumes no limiter capacity. Synchronous processor throws
are shared across the batch without invoking the processor again. A global
Worker limiter rejects `minSize > limiter.max`; `size` may remain larger and
ready work is processed in capacity-bounded chunks. The `groupKey` limiter form
is per-group concurrency and is not subject to this rolling-window constraint.

Processors receive `{ signal }` as their second argument. `cancelJob`,
`cancelAllJobs`, and per-job `timeout` abort that signal and Observable
subscriptions are unsubscribed. A native batch composes every member signal:
cancelling or timing out any member aborts the shared processor invocation and
all members observe its shared outcome. Promise processors remain cooperative:
aborting does not fabricate cancellation of a Promise that ignores its signal. A
structural Observable is accepted without an RxJS dependency; its final
emission becomes the job result, and its teardown runs exactly once after
completion, failure, or abort, including synchronous settlement. `QueuePro`,
`WorkerPro`, `QueueEventsPro`, and `JobPro` are compatibility aliases over the
same native implementations.

`rateLimitGroup(job, duration)` requires a grouped active job, installs a
broker-authoritative manual deadline for that group, then returns the current
delivery to waiting with its lease token. It is effective without a configured
`group.limit`; SQLite keeps the live manual deadline in process while
PostgreSQL stores it transactionally for all brokers.
The deadline is committed before the active delivery is returned to waiting;
if that lease transition rejects, the Promise rejects but the group cooldown
remains active.

In embedded mode the constructor claims the same process-wide manager used by
Queue and QueueEvents. A supplied `dataPath` must identify its active database;
a mismatch throws synchronously before polling or worker registration begins.

`run()` (`worker/runtime/control.ts`) sets `running`, defers a `ready` emit via
`queueMicrotask` (so immediately attached listeners still fire), subscribes to
queue-scoped stalled events, registers the worker, and starts job-lease and
worker-registration heartbeat timers. In TCP mode it waits for the dedicated
event subscription attempt before the first poll; a failed event connection
does not suppress processing, and normal reconnect logic later re-subscribes.
`pause()` stops new polling but intentionally preserves both heartbeat timers:
active and buffered deliveries must retain their leases, and the broker must
retain the worker registration. `resume()` reuses those timers instead of
creating duplicate intervals, so repeated pause/resume cycles remain
idempotent and `close()` can release every owned runtime handle. Starting
`close()` is a terminal lifecycle transition: `run()` and `resume()` become
no-ops as soon as shutdown owns its promise, so a stale timer or callback
cannot clear the closing/force state and restart polling during teardown.

### Pull loop

`poll()` (`worker/runtime/polling.ts`) first retires its current wake-up handle,
then returns if not running/closing. If `activeJobs >= concurrency` it
reschedules in 10ms; if the rate limiter blocks, it waits for the next slot;
otherwise it starts `tryProcess()` immediately. Worker startup, timer wake-ups,
and resume therefore keep their existing scheduling behavior. Only job
completion callbacks use the `processingScheduled` gate and a shared follow-up
dispatch, so a released wave of 64 leases requests the next available capacity
with one `PULLB` instead of racing 64 one-job `PULL` transactions. Every concurrency, group,
empty-pull, rate-limit and error-backoff path uses one earliest-deadline scheduler, so
concurrent completion and pull continuations leave at most one live poll timer
without allowing a later request to postpone an earlier wake-up. The timer
callback verifies that it still owns the current handle before polling;
`pause()` and `close()` use the same idempotent cleanup. This preserves the
existing delays and pull fan-out without allowing completed jobs to create
self-perpetuating orphan timer chains (issue #113). `tryProcess()` repeats the
limiter check before any batch pull, so its pipelined fan-out cannot bypass
admission.

`tryProcess()` (`worker/runtime/polling.ts`) picks an eligible buffered job
(`runtime/buffer.ts`) or pulls a batch. After the async pull it **re-checks**
`running/_closing` and the concurrency gate before `startJob`; a full gate puts
the item back at the buffer front (issue #96). Empty polls emit `drained` at
most once per second.

`doPullBatch()` (`worker/runtime/polling.ts`) computes the **leased** count,
subtracts `pendingPull`, caps the batch at 1,000 and at the unconsumed worker
rate budget, and reserves the requested slots across the asynchronous pull
(issue #98). A worker limited to two starts therefore leases at most two jobs;
the rest remain broker-visible as waiting. `runtime/buffer.ts` registers the
leases and immediately renews freshly pulled locks when a multi-connection
pool could otherwise create a re-dispatch window.

Every successful pull is assigned a monotonically increasing local delivery
generation in `runtime/state.ts`. `startJob()` (`runtime/execution.ts`) rejects
only an exact duplicate generation; a stall-recovered delivery of the same job
id can start while its stale handler is still running when concurrency permits.
It then atomically acquires the worker rate token at the actual dispatch
boundary. A denied item is returned to the local buffer. Cleanup is
generation-conditional: an old `.finally` decrements only its own active/group
counts and cannot delete the current token, heartbeat membership, cancellation
state, or pulled-job tracking. Automatic and manual processing share this
contract.

`WorkerRateLimiter` uses a rolling start-time window. `rateLimit(ms)` is a
separate temporary override: it blocks admission even when no normal limiter
is configured or when `groupKey` selects group-concurrency mode. The effective
wait is the longer of the rolling-window wait and the override. Manual
`processJobManually()` uses the same admission rule and waits without invoking
the processor until both its rate token and group slot are available.

`getNextJob()` returns a `ManualJob<T>` copy rather than the broker's mutable
domain object. Its first-class `name` is separate from the typed user `data`,
and `token` contains the broker lease when locks are enabled. Passing that job
to `processJobManually()` without a token reuses its tracked lease; an explicit
token must match. The worker processes the canonical tracked delivery, and a
job object from an older redelivery generation cannot replace or publish an
outcome through the current generation.

### Processing & outcome (`processor.ts`, `processorOutcome.ts`)

`processJob` builds the public `Job` with all handlers (`worker/handlers/`),
emits `active`, then awaits `processor(job)`. A confirmed `moveToCompleted()`,
`moveToFailed()`, `retry()`, `changeDelay()`, `moveToWait()`,
`moveToDelayed()`, or `moveToWaitingChildren()` consumes the current processing
generation, so the Worker skips its automatic ACK and catch-path FAIL. The five
asynchronous nonterminal handlers mark ownership only after the broker confirms
the transition; a rejected token therefore still enters normal failure
handling. Otherwise the Worker acks — embedded
`manager.ack(id, result, token)` or `ackBatcher.queue(...)` — then emits
`completed`. Failure/manual/delayed outcome logic is isolated in
`processorOutcome.ts`. `shouldAbandonOutcome` checks both
forced shutdown and delivery currency: once a newer generation is registered,
the stale processor sends no ACK, FAIL, delayed transition, or terminal event.
A broker-side token/generation check remains the final race guard.
Completion handler factories take one explicit options record so transport,
lease token, retention policy, and manual-transition callbacks stay coupled.

`Job.discard()` retains its synchronous public signature, but its Worker
handler registers one pending disposition before returning. `processJob`
awaits that non-rejecting settlement, including during graceful close, and
never races it with ACK/FAIL. Duplicate calls share the first command. An
authoritative already-absent job is silent; a real transport/engine rejection
emits one `error` with `context: 'discard'` and leaves lease/stall recovery in
charge. The Worker sends its captured token, so a stale processor cannot
discard a newer delivery generation.

Failure path (`handleJobFailure`, `processorOutcome.ts`): `DelayedError` →
`handleDelayedError` re-delays the job by `calculateDelayedErrorDelay(job)`
(`src/domain/job/state.ts`) without counting a failure and forwards the current
lease token in both transports. The wait is `min(base, cap)` with no attempt
growth and no jitter. `base` is `backoffConfig ? backoffConfig.delay : backoff`
when that is a positive number, else `1000` (covers `0`, negative and `NaN`
bases from embedded admission). `cap` is `backoffConfig.maxDelay` when that is a
positive finite number, else `DEFAULT_MAX_BACKOFF`. A `maxDelay` of `0` (which
makes failed retries immediate) does not apply here: DelayedError never counts
an attempt, so a zero wait would let a processor that keeps throwing it re-pull
the job in a tight loop. The wait is therefore always positive and finite, and
a `maxDelay: 0` job waits its base delay capped at 1 hour. Embedded calls
`manager.moveToDelayed`; TCP sends `MoveToDelayed` with that `delay`, using the
`backoffConfig` parsed from the pulled job. `SandboxedWorker` does not recognize
`DelayedError`: the error crosses the worker-thread boundary as a message string
and the job is failed like any other error;
`UnrecoverableError` → forces `maxAttempts=1, attempts=0` so retries are
skipped; stack lines are computed _before_ the send (capped at 50 on the wire,
authoritative cap server-side — bug #74), then `FAIL` is sent (embedded
`manager.fail`, TCP `FAIL` with `stack`/`token`/`unrecoverable`). `failedReason`
and `stacktrace` are populated on the event object, then `failed` is emitted
only when the broker confirms that this processing generation applied the
transition. If an exact timeout/retired-cron generation already won, the
structured `applied:false` response is authoritative: automatic failure,
manual `moveToFailed`, ACK, and ACKB emit neither `failed`/`completed` nor an
`error`, and do not increment Worker counters or release a newer lease.

### Sandboxed flow (`sandboxed/runtime/`)

`lifecycle.ts` writes the wrapper, starts the process pool, owns heartbeat and
shutdown. `pool.ts` spawns/recycles Bun Workers and runs the pull loop.
`dispatch.ts` owns the per-job timeout and routes result/error/progress/log IPC
messages, rejecting messages that do not match the worker's current job.
It claims the local generation before awaiting ACK/FAIL, cancels its local
timer, and keeps the thread busy until the broker settles. A late result,
processor error, explicit `job.fail`, or local sandbox timeout is silent when
the broker reports that an earlier timeout already finalized that generation.
`recovery.ts` fails crashed work, bounds respawns by `maxRestarts`, renews
leases, and creates the public event job. Idle recycling keeps at least one
process alive; `autoStart` can watch the queue after an idle stop.

## Concurrency & Locking

- **Concurrency cap** is enforced as a leased cap (`pulledJobIds.size`), not
  just `activeJobs`, plus the `pendingPull` reservation in
  `worker/runtime/polling.ts`. The gate is re-checked immediately before
  `startJob` in `runtime/execution.ts`.
- **Lock-based ownership** (`useLocks`, default true): each pulled job gets a
  `token`; heartbeats renew the lock for **all** `pulledJobIds` (active and
  buffered) so buffered jobs don't expire (`workerHeartbeat.ts:24`). Lock TTL =
  `lockDuration` (default 30000), propagated to the server via `lockTtl` on
  pull (`workerPull.ts:79`). Manual pulls expose the same broker token on the
  returned `ManualJob`; manual processing reuses the tracked value when its
  token argument is omitted. ACK, FAIL, batched ACK, shutdown requeue, and all
  manual active-state moves forward that token. The broker requires the exact
  token whenever a lock exists in both transports; unlocked jobs retain the
  administrative transition path. See
  [Concurrency & Locking](./concurrency-and-locking.md).
- **PostgreSQL disconnect fencing:** the multi-broker manager snapshots all
  tracked `(jobId, token)` pairs before the first awaited or deferred release.
  Store fencing revalidates that immutable token, and local cleanup removes it
  only if the active-token map still contains the same value. Reusing a custom
  ID while old disconnect work is queued cannot release or forget the newer
  lease. This is PostgreSQL adapter behavior; the existing SQLite lock path is
  unchanged.
- **Stall race (#33)**: stall detection may re-dispatch a job while the old
  handler still runs. The new pull receives a fresh broker token and local
  delivery generation. Only the current generation is heartbeated and allowed
  to publish an automatic outcome; stale cleanup cannot erase its state.
- **Re-dispatch window (multi-connection)**: with `poolSize>1`, PULL and
  heartbeats may travel on different sockets; `worker/runtime/buffer.ts` sends
  an immediate heartbeat after a lock-based batch pull.
- **Group concurrency**: `GroupConcurrencyLimiter` caps `limiter.max` active
  jobs per group; `runtime/buffer.ts` scans for a runnable group and
  `runtime/polling.ts` permits bounded pull-ahead when the buffer is blocked.
  Automatic and manual dispatch increment the group exactly once and release
  it in their terminal cleanup; `duration` remains unused in group mode.
  Group-value extraction never throws (see
  [Rate Limiting & Concurrency](./rate-limiting-and-concurrency.md)), so a
  producer-supplied value such as `{ toString: 'x' }` cannot break the pull
  loop, the ACK frontier, or the `concurrency` setter.

## Edge Cases & Failure Modes

- **Pull errors**: `handlePullError` in `worker/runtime/polling.ts` emits
  `error` with `consecutiveErrors` / `context:'pull'` and backs off
  exponentially from 100ms to 30s. A successful pick resets the counter.
- **ACK batching/backpressure** (`ackBatcher.ts`, `ackFrontier.ts`): flush triggers at the configured batch size, capped in TCP mode by an event-driven reachable-outcome frontier, or after `interval` (`DEFAULT_ACK_INTERVAL=50ms`). The frontier is the ACKs already pending plus started delivery generations that can still ACK plus scalar buffered deliveries that can start without first settling a pending ACK. Buffered eligibility observes runtime concurrency, rate capacity, and simulated per-group reservations; a sealed native batch contributes its exact started members rather than its configured maximum. A generation transfers synchronously from the unqueued set into the pending batch, while failure, an applied manual transition, pause, rate-limit changes, concurrency changes, and close re-evaluate a reduced frontier. ACKs assigned to an in-flight flush no longer contribute to later batches. Evaluating the dynamic ceiling never throws out of `queue()` or `notifyCapacityChanged()`: once an ACK is pushed into the pending batch it stays owned by the batcher, so if the ceiling callback throws, the batcher falls back to the static `batchSize` (the `interval` timer is still armed), reports the error through `onThresholdError` (the Worker emits `error` with `context: 'ack-threshold'` only when an `error` listener exists; a throwing observer is ignored), and never rejects the ACK promise — so a successful job is never turned into a FAIL, and the `concurrency`/`pause`/`rateLimit` setters and failure-path frontier retirements cannot throw from it. The buffer is bounded at `MAX_PENDING_ACKS=10000`; `queue()` blocks (awaits in-flight, then flushes) rather than dropping acks. `sendBatchWithRetry` retries transient failures up to `maxRetries=3` with exponential backoff (`100,200,400ms`). A valid structured `ignoredIndices` response settles only those exact pending positions as `false` without retry or error; malformed/unknown evidence is rejected. On true exhaustion it logs `(N acks lost)` and rejects each pending promise. `stop()` clears any still-queued acks _without settling their promises_ (callers are expected to `flush()` + `waitForInFlight()` first, as `Worker.close()` does); a batch already mid-retry when `stop()` lands is rejected with `AckBatcher stopped`.
- **Graceful close** (`worker/runtime/lifecycle.ts`): `close(false)` stops
  timers, moves buffered leased jobs back to waiting, waits only for active
  processors, flushes ACKs, unregisters, and closes the pool. `close(true)`
  breaks an in-progress graceful drain. Shutdown state is monotonic from the
  first call, so stale `run()`/`resume()` calls cannot pull a batch after close
  begins. It cannot cancel arbitrary user code,
  so a processor may still return later; that late outcome is abandoned before
  any broker command or event. The unfinished job remains recoverable through
  disconnect handling or server lock/stall expiry.
- **Ownership and waiting-children transitions:** processor and sandboxed `Job` objects route `removeDeduplicationKey` through the owner-aware manager/wire operation and route `moveToWaitingChildren` through the real broker transition in both modes. A stale deduplication owner returns `false`; moving a non-active job returns `false` or a broker error rather than silently changing unrelated state.
- **Job mutation handlers** (`processorHandlers.ts`) are state-aware: `retry`
  dispatches by job state (failed → `retryDlq`, active → `moveActiveToWait`,
  waiting/prioritized/delayed → no-op, else throw); `moveToDelayed` converts an
  absolute timestamp to a relative delay. Processor-owned `retry()`,
  `changeDelay()`, and synchronous `discard()` bind the delivery token captured
  by `processJob`. Embedded calls pass it directly to the manager and TCP calls
  include it in `MoveToWait`/`ChangeDelay`/`Discard`; rejected broker responses
  cannot become silent automatic completions.
- **Sandboxed dispatch failure** awaits the authoritative broker transition and
  resets the worker only after settlement (`sandboxed/runtime/dispatch.ts`).
  Ignored retired generations are silent. Crash/timeout recovery and guarded error
  emission live in `sandboxed/runtime/recovery.ts`; wrapper-path escaping lives
  in `sandboxed/wrapper.ts`.
- **`prefixKey` mismatch**: a Worker only consumes jobs whose producing Queue
  used the same prefix; `worker/runtime/state.ts` creates `queueKey`, and
  `runtime/control.ts` scopes stalled events to it.
- **`skipStalledCheck` scope**: in either runtime it disables only this Worker's
  `stalled` listener subscription. It does not disable broker-side recovery,
  stall counters, retries, or DLQ transitions.

## Configuration

- **`WorkerOptions`** (see Data Models) — primary knobs. Defaults: `concurrency=1`, `heartbeatInterval=10000` (`0` disables), `batchSize=10` (max `1000`), `pollTimeout=0` (max `30000`), `useLocks=true`, `lockDuration=30000`, `drainDelay=50`, `maxStalledCount=1`, `autorun=true`.
- **`FORCE_EMBEDDED` / `WORKER_CONSTANTS`** (`worker/constants.ts`): the env
  override plus backoff, poll-timeout, and ACK-interval constants.
- **`SandboxedWorkerOptions`** defaults: `concurrency=1`, `maxMemory=256` (≤64 → Bun `smol` mode), `timeout=30000` (`0` disables), `autoRestart=true`, `maxRestarts=10`, `pollInterval=10`, `heartbeatInterval=10000` (TCP) / `5000` (embedded), `idleTimeout=0` (disabled), `idleRecycleMs=30000`, `autoStart=false`, `autoStartPollMs=5000`.
- TCP connection options are resolved by `createTcpPool` in
  `worker/runtime/options.ts`. Server env (`WORKER_TIMEOUT_MS`,
  `LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS`) affects server-side stall/lock handling, not the client.
