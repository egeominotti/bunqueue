# Model-Based Queue Verification

## Purpose

The state-machine suites in `test/model-based/` verify bunqueue, S3
backup/restore, and monitoring aggregates by comparing implementations with
small executable specifications. They use
`fast-check` commands, preconditions, shrinking, and seed replay. The primary
queue command model is not mocked: every property run starts `src/main.ts`, uses
the public MessagePack TCP protocol, writes a fresh SQLite database, and can
terminate the process with `SIGKILL` before reconnecting. A crash restart kills
the broker while the model client is still connected and closes the client only
afterwards (`stopModelBroker`): closing it first would let the broker persist a
disconnect release, so whether a held job is charged would depend on which of
the socket close and the signal the broker saw first. Focused workflow and
FlowProducer models use their real embedded engines so they can run many
structural cases cheaply; dedicated E2E suites cover their TCP boundary.

The model complements example-based unit and integration tests. Examples prove
known scenarios; generated command histories explore valid interleavings and
shrink a failure to the shortest reproducible history.

### Focused backup and monitoring models

`backup-model.test.ts` drives a real SQLite database and an in-memory S3
contract through inserts, WAL-pinning readers, backup, restore, retention and
corrupt payloads. After every generated command it verifies source rows,
published payload/metadata pairing, exact point-in-time restore, stale-sidecar
isolation, retention order, and failure atomicity. The default campaign is 50
histories of up to 30 commands.

`monitoring-model.test.ts` drives `WorkerManager` through register,
re-register, heartbeat, active-job increment, complete/fail and unregister
transitions. For 500 histories of up to 80 actions it asserts that registered
workers, active jobs, concurrency slots and outcome counters equal a simple map
model, then checks the Prometheus gauges against the same aggregates.

`enterprise-telemetry-model.test.ts` generates 500 histories of backup
start/success/failure/overlap/scheduler actions and 1,000 queue-cardinality
cases. It asserts attempt conservation, exact scheduler/activity state,
compressed-size/timestamp/duration fidelity, exact overlap accounting, bounded
queue selection, subset order, and `exported + omitted == registered`.

### Workflow command model

`workflow-model.test.ts` builds generated workflow graphs into the real
embedded `Engine` and a real SQLite store. Every case starts a run even when
the generated command history is empty, so the campaign cannot pass vacuously.
Graphs include retrying/failing steps, parallel groups, total and missing
branch choices, timed/untimed gates, `forEach`, successful/failing `map`
transforms, pivots, child workflows and fallible compensation.

Commands interleave signals, time for progress, graceful restart/recovery, live
recovery while another driver exists, recovery during unwind, and operator
resume/abandon. After every action the oracle checks:

- signal fidelity and first-writer-wins payloads;
- monotonic cursor progress and no terminal resurrection;
- gate and branch ordering;
- cumulative retry bounds plus stable idempotency keys;
- durable-name and counter/index domains;
- exactly-once compensation outcomes, pivot cutoff and rollback coherence;
- parent/child ownership and no independent live-child unwind;
- `map` exclusive delivery plus coherent completed/failed records;
- final non-vacuous liveness after opening untimed gates and resolving parked
  compensation.

Bun 1.4 changed timer scheduling enough to make seed `-795204925`, path `10`,
deterministically expose an old Engine's retry backoff waking after
`close(true)` while its replacement recovered the same node. The preserved
`repro-model-workflow-force-close-retry.test.ts` history verifies that the old
executor stops before another handler dispatch and that the cumulative retry
budget remains authoritative across the replacement.

The same file runs focused Fast-Check properties for every filtered execution
page against the SQLite oracle (`createdAt DESC, id DESC`) and for invalid
timeout/iteration/child-poll bounds. The harness reads all pages rather than
silently checking only the default first 100 executions.

### FlowProducer graph model

`flow-producer-model.test.ts` generates one to three bounded-depth trees with
random payloads, priorities, and queue ownership. Every node receives a
shrink-friendly deterministic custom ID. The public `FlowProducer.addBulk`
result is compared with real manager state and `getFlow` traversal.

Each run checks:

- global ID uniqueness and exact node conservation across queue counts;
- symmetric `parentId`, `childrenIds`, and `dependsOn` edges;
- actual cross-queue ownership and correct initial
  `waiting`/`prioritized`/`waiting-children` state;
- `depth` and `maxChildren`, including zero, against the generated tree;
- whole-batch rejection: a late custom-ID collision cannot publish an earlier
  valid root.

Use `BUNQUEUE_FLOW_MODEL_SEED` and `BUNQUEUE_FLOW_MODEL_RUNS` for deterministic
replay or deeper campaigns. `flow-producer-real-e2e.test.ts` complements the
model with a dynamic-port TCP broker, SQLite, multi-queue workers, failure
metadata, and a full broker restart.

### Isolated broker startup

Every property run probes an adjacent TCP/HTTP port pair, starts its own broker,
waits for the unauthenticated HTTP `/ready` response, and then verifies the TCP
`Hello` identity before executing commands. The harness watches the subprocess
exit code and drains stderr while it starts. A confirmed bind collision is
retried on a fresh pair up to five times. A failed TCP handshake after apparent
HTTP readiness is retried too, because another process may own that `/ready`
endpoint even when Bun's reusable-port probe succeeded. Timeouts and non-bind
failures before readiness still fail immediately. Exhausted retries retain the
phase, both ports, prior retry count, exit diagnostics, and captured stderr. This
removes both probe-to-bind and foreign-readiness races without silently ignoring
schema or configuration failures.

## Covered state

`QueueModel` records:

- logical API state (`waiting`, `prioritized`, `waiting-children`, `delayed`,
  `active`, `completed`, or `failed`);
- the physical SQLite representation, which intentionally differs for retry
  backoff (`GetState=delayed`, `jobs.state=waiting`) but preserves authoritative
  initial `prioritized` and `waiting-children` states;
- accepted and removed lifecycle generations, payload generation, terminal
  generations, retry attempts, stall count, bounds, and priority for every
  custom job ID;
- live lock tokens, pause, concurrency, rate-limit configuration and remaining
  rate tokens;
- generation history even after drain, purge, cancel, or obliterate, allowing
  recycled custom IDs to expose stale-row resurrection.

Generated commands cover single and batch push/pull/ack, retryable and terminal
failure, progress, payload update, priority and delay changes, promote,
`MoveToWait`, cancel/discard, per-job and aggregate DLQ/completed retry, DLQ
purge, pause/resume, drain/obliterate, concurrency and rate limits, batched lock
heartbeats, parent/child dependency release and failure policies, and actual
crash/restart. Focused contract commands also cover FIFO/LIFO priority ties,
delays, TTL expiry, FIFO groups, unique keys, exclusive leases, and
rate-limit/concurrency token rollback.
Generated discard commands carry the captured lease token when the modeled job
is active, matching the same fencing contract as ACK, FAIL, delay, and retry
transitions; waiting and delayed administrative discards remain tokenless.
The minimized seed `676055362` is also preserved as a deterministic SQLite
regression: DLQ and completed retries must restore custom-ID and unique-key
ownership, reject ownership conflicts without removing terminal work, and
leave RAM plus disk unchanged when persistence fails.

`cross-queue-invariants.ts` adds a second generated history over four queues.
Names are selected at runtime so two queues share an owning shard and, when the
host has multiple shards, at least one is on a different shard. Histories
interleave durable push/complete, pause/resume, `CompactMemory`, and real
process restart. This covers both accidental cross-queue mutation within one
shard and accidental cross-shard/global-index corruption.

## Oracle checks

After every executed command, `RealQueue.assertConsistent` checks all observable
layers:

1. Lifecycle conservation: accepted minus explicitly removed generations equals
   all live states, with failed jobs counted once as DLQ.
2. `GetState` and `GetJob` for every modeled job, including payload, priority,
   attempts, maximum attempts, and cumulative stall count.
3. No terminal generation can be delivered again, no job can hold two active
   leases, and every modeled active job has exactly one live token.
4. `Count`, `GetJobCounts`, and `GetCountsPerPriority`, including paused and
   `waiting-children` views.
5. Exact membership and state in SQLite `jobs` and `dlq`, with at most one DLQ
   row per job.
6. MessagePack payload, retry metadata, priority, `queue_state.paused`,
   concurrency, rate-limit and stall-policy persistence.
7. Internal `/stats` collection cardinalities for `jobIndex`, shard queue
   counters, processing maps, waiting dependencies, completed jobs, and locks.

The cross-queue oracle additionally reconciles every queue's paused, waiting,
and completed counts; ID-to-queue ownership and payload through TCP; the entire
`jobs` table through a read-only SQLite connection; and global `jobIndex`,
queued, completed, processing, and lock cardinalities through `/stats` after
every operation. `CompactMemory` is checked as an observable no-op, not merely
as a command that does not throw.

The generated transitions also assert the following contracts:

- only legal state-graph edges occur;
- custom IDs are idempotent while live and create a new generation only after a
  terminal state;
- `attempts <= maxAttempts` and `stallCount <= maxStalls`; exceeding either
  bound is terminal;
- crash recovery increments the persisted counters, never leaves a ghost
  `active` row, and is idempotent across consecutive restarts;
- priority, FIFO/LIFO, delay, groups, dependencies and unique keys preserve
  their documented delivery rules;
- concurrency and rate tokens remain bounded and are rolled back when a pull
  cannot acquire every required resource;
- retrying a completed job clears its result and execution metadata in memory
  and SQLite before the waiting generation becomes visible, and restart cannot
  restore the retired completed result;
- expired jobs are never delivered and are deleted exactly once from memory,
  counters, indexes, the write buffer and SQLite.

Priority pulls must always select the highest currently ready priority. Batch
responses must have matching job/token lengths and observe concurrency and rate
capacity. Assertions preserve the public wire envelope instead of flattening
handler payloads: `JobHeartbeatB` reports renewed jobs as
`{ ok: true, data: { ok: true, count } }`, so the model reads `data.count`;
`ACKB` instead returns top-level `{ ok: true }` with no `count` or `data`
payload. The ACK model requires that exact success envelope and sends
`ids`/`tokens`/`results` in the same index order. A crash clears tokens, reloads
persisted queue controls, resets the rate bucket, and reclassifies active rows
through the broker's recovery backoff.

## Running and replaying

The bounded broker default is 150 property runs with up to 80 generated
commands. The same command also runs the focused backup, worker-monitoring and
enterprise-telemetry models and 40 workflow graphs with up to 12 commands:

```bash
bun run test:model
```

It also runs 24 cross-queue histories of up to 30 operations. Tune
that campaign independently with:

```bash
BUNQUEUE_CROSS_QUEUE_RUNS=100 \
BUNQUEUE_CROSS_QUEUE_COMMANDS=100 \
bun run test:model
```

Tune a focused campaign without editing the test:

```bash
BUNQUEUE_MODEL_RUNS=500 \
BUNQUEUE_MODEL_COMMANDS=150 \
BUNQUEUE_MODEL_SEED=424242 \
bun run test:model
```

Tune only the workflow campaign with:

```bash
BUNQUEUE_WF_MODEL_RUNS=500 \
BUNQUEUE_WF_MODEL_COMMANDS=150 \
BUNQUEUE_WF_MODEL_SEED=-1267197984 \
bun run test:model
```

`fast-check` prints the seed, counterexample, and replay path for every failure.
Preserve the minimized history as a deterministic `test/repro-model-*.test.ts`
regression before changing runtime code. The default unit suite, and therefore
`bun run test:sandbox`, includes this state machine automatically.

## Defects found by the model

The expanded campaign and its full-suite gate found eleven classes of lifecycle,
durability, recovery, and persistence-boundary defects:

- `Update` changed data only in memory; restart restored the old payload.
- `ChangePriority` reordered the live heap but did not persist priority/LIFO;
  restart restored the old scheduling order.
- repeated crash recovery reset `stallCount`, allowing a job to evade
  `maxStalls`;
- crash recovery ignored `maxAttempts`, so work could be requeued beyond its
  delivery bound;
- TTL cleanup removed a job from live indexes and counters but could leave its
  SQLite row or buffered insert behind, making the expired job observable again.
- `Obliterate` cleared the run heap but left dependency-gated parents in
  `waitingDeps`/`waitingChildren` and their reverse dependency index, so an
  empty queue still reported and returned a ghost `waiting-children` job.
- manual and age-based DLQ purge cleared the shard entries but left dangling
  `jobIndex` and auxiliary state, so a permanently deleted job still reported
  `failed` and could retain durable rows.
- reusing a terminal custom ID admitted the new live generation without
  retiring its prior DLQ generation, breaking conservation and global ID
  uniqueness.
- moving an active job back to delayed released scheduling resources but left
  its live lease and TCP-client ownership entries behind.
- moving an active job back to waiting updated memory, counters, ownership, and
  delivery state but left its durable row `active`, so restart charged a
  phantom crash attempt instead of restoring ready work.
- adding persisted `stall_count` made legacy and low-level jobs without an
  explicit `stallCount` fail the SQLite `NOT NULL` constraint. The persistence
  boundary now normalizes only an omitted value to zero for single, buffered,
  batch, retry, and decode paths.

The permanent regressions exercise the public TCP and real persistence paths.
The fixes persist effective mutations, retry/stall metadata and stall policy,
enforce both terminal bounds in every recovery path, restore the DLQ exactly
once, cancel buffered inserts when TTL expires, fully delete purged DLQ
generations, and purge dependency maps plus their global and persisted state
during obliteration. Terminal-ID reuse locks the target and prior-owner shards
in deterministic order and exposes exactly one generation. Management commands
that claim active work now release lease and client ownership through one
idempotent transition.

The workflow model additionally found or permanently covers duplicate live
node execution, independent child recovery causing double compensation,
timeout failure reasons omitted from persistence, cumulative retry budgets
reset on re-entry, non-journaled control-flow decisions, and missing durable
records for failed maps. Confirmed engine divergences are preserved as
`test/repro-model-workflow-*.test.ts` before their runtime fix.

## 71-invariant coverage register

The project tracks the executable production checklist as 71 invariants in 19
categories. The number is a coverage register, not a claim that one property
tests every subsystem. The main lifecycle state machine owns the invariants
that can be checked deterministically after each generated command; focused
state machines and integration suites own wall-clock, protocol, cron,
migration, and worker-runtime contracts.

Adding an invariant to this register requires an executable assertion and a
named owning suite. Specialist coverage is not silently presented as part of
`fc.commands`; future cron, migration, or network models should remain focused
unless they can preserve deterministic shrinking.

## Retention-boundary invariant

`test/repro-retention-boundary-invariants.test.ts` forces
`maxCompletedJobs=3` and `maxJobResults=2`, completes twelve durable jobs, and
checks the boundary before and after restart. Hot collections stay within their
configured caps, while every job state, payload, and result remains observable
through SQLite and durable `jobs`/`job_results` membership is conserved. This
suite covers retained jobs and distinguishes permitted cache eviction from
durable data loss.

`test/repro-dependency-completion-retention.test.ts` and
`test/repro-dependency-completion-pinning.test.ts` separately exercise the
payload-free `removeOnComplete` contract. They prove the SQLite table and RAM
tracker retain the same newest unpinned FIFO window, a batch larger than the cap
cannot evict proofs owned by unresolved parents, a late parent pins an existing
proof, shared ownership lasts through the final waiter, a lower restart cap
cannot prune before reverse-edge reconstruction, an evicted proof cannot
regress a checkpointed parent, obliteration releases the correct ownership, a
custom-ID generation cannot inherit an older completion, a late stall ACK
survives restart, and an injected SQLite failure cannot delete the job without
creating its proof.

## Candidate invariants not yet enforceable

The audit does not count a desired property as covered when current behavior
violates it or the required state is not observable.

| Candidate | Desired invariant                                                                                                                                     | Current blocker                                                                                       |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| C6        | Every persisted lifecycle transition is atomic under injected I/O failure                                                                             | Existing failure tests are examples, not a transition-by-transition storage fault model               |

| C8        | Strong custom-ID/unique-key idempotency holds for every live job                                                                                      | Bounded LRU/registry trimming intentionally weakens the guarantee after eviction                      |
| C9        | Internal resource conservation is directly observable for unique keys, groups, limiter tokens, temporal reverse indexes, and dependency reverse edges | `/stats` exposes aggregate subsets, so exact independent cardinality oracles need diagnostic counters |
| C10       | JSON monitoring totals remain exact across the full `bigint` range                                                                                    | TCP/HTTP stats convert to `number` and lose precision above 2^53                                      |

C1-C3 are now executable invariants 54-56. C4-C10 require a core contract decision, new observability, or a
fault-injection seam before a non-flaky invariant can be mandatory. None is
weakened into a characterization test merely to keep the gate green.

## Extension rule

When a new queue transition or persisted control is added, introduce a command,
model transition, and post-command oracle here. Keep feature-specific timing
systems such as cron and workflow execution in focused state machines rather
than adding wall-clock assumptions to this lifecycle model.
