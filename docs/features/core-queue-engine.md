# Core Queue Engine (QueueManager & Shards)

> **Category:** Engine · **Source:** `src/application/queueManager.ts`, `src/application/queue-manager/`, `src/application/operations/`, `src/application/types/`, `src/domain/queue/shard.ts`, `src/domain/queue/shard/`, `src/shared/hash.ts`

## Purpose

`QueueManager` is the stable public façade for the central coordinator. The façade itself is six lines; a capability chain under `queue-manager/` owns state and exposes push / pull / ack / fail, queries, queue control, DLQ, cron, locks, stats, dependencies and lifecycle. It partitions queues across a fixed array of `Shard` instances, maintains the global indexes that map a job ID to its current location, and keeps hot-path operations sharded and lock-scoped while delegating algorithms to focused operation modules through typed contexts.

## Responsibilities & Scope

Owns:

- The shard arrays: `shards`, `shardLocks`, `processingShards`, `processingLocks` (`queue-manager/state.ts`), one entry per `SHARD_COUNT`.
- The global indexes: `jobIndex` (Map), `completedJobs` (BoundedSet),
  `completedJobsData` (BoundedMap), `depCompletions`
  (`DependencyCompletionTracker`: exact recent FIFO plus live pins),
  `timedOutJobs` / `retiredTimeoutLeaseTokens` (BoundedMap generation proofs),
  `retiredCronLeaseTokens` (BoundedMap), and
  `jobResults`/`customIdMap`/`jobLogs` (LRUMap).
- Lock ownership and flow state in `queue-manager/state.ts`; ACK/lease recovery in `queue-manager/ack.ts`, `delivery.ts` and `locks.ts`; flow propagation in `flow-failures.ts`, `flow-options.ts` and `dependency-runtime.ts`.
- Shard selection and routing of every operation to the owning shard.
- Lifecycle: recovery from storage at construction, background-task startup, and `shutdown()` teardown of all collections.
- `Shard` owns per-shard queue containers (`IndexedPriorityQueue` per queue name), unique-key dedup, DLQ, rate/concurrency limiters, dependency tracking, temporal index, waiter notifications, and O(1) running counters. The façade is `src/domain/queue/shard.ts`; the focused capability chain lives under `src/domain/queue/shard/`, starting with `state.ts:13-100`.

Does NOT own (delegated):

- The push/pull/ack/fail algorithms — delegated to `operations/push`, `operations/pull`, `operations/ack` via contexts (see [Job Lifecycle](./job-lifecycle.md)).
- Lock token creation/verification/expiry — delegated to `lockManager` (see [Concurrency & Locking](./concurrency-and-locking.md)).
- Persistence — delegated to `SqliteStorage` / WriteBuffer (see [Persistence](./persistence.md)).
- Queries & queue control logic — `operations/queryOperations`, `operations/queueControl` (see [Job Queries & Control](./job-queries-and-control.md)).
- DLQ, cron, stats, webhooks, workers, background tasks — separate managers/modules (see [DLQ](./dead-letter-queue.md), [Scheduler & Cron](./scheduler-and-cron.md), [Background Tasks](./background-tasks.md), [Stats](./stats-and-monitoring.md)).
- The priority queue / heap / map data structures — see [Data Structures](./data-structures.md).

## Dependencies

Internal:

- `Shard` (`src/domain/queue/shard.ts`) and `ShardCounters` (`src/domain/queue/shardCounters.ts`).

- Bun APIs: `Bun.randomUUIDv7()` and `navigator.hardwareConcurrency` in
  `shared/hash.ts`; `queueMicrotask` for dependency-flush coalescing in
  `queue-manager/dependency-runtime.ts`.

## Public Interface

`QueueManager` is exported from `queueManager.ts`; all methods below are inherited
from focused classes in `queue-manager/`. Selected real signatures:

This class is invoked by the TCP and HTTP command handlers; it does not itself parse the wire protocol or expose endpoints. See [TCP Server Handlers](./tcp-server-handlers.md) and [HTTP API](./http-api.md) for the command/endpoint surface that maps onto these methods.

Hashing functions (`src/shared/hash.ts`):

- `fnv1a(str: string): number` (`hash.ts:13`) — 32-bit FNV-1a, unsigned.
- `shardIndex(key: string): number` → `fnv1a(key) & SHARD_MASK` (`hash.ts:47`).
- `processingShardIndex(jobId: string): number` → `fnv1a(jobId) & SHARD_MASK` (`hash.ts:54`).
- `SHARD_COUNT` / `SHARD_MASK` (`hash.ts:44-45`), `uuid()` → `Bun.randomUUIDv7()` (`hash.ts:62`), `constantTimeEqual(a, b)` (`hash.ts:70`).

`Shard` (exported façade, `src/domain/queue/shard.ts:8`) — selected methods:
`getQueue(name)`, `getState`/`isPaused`/`pause`/`resume`, unique-key methods
including owner-aware release, FIFO group methods,
`releaseJobResources(queue, uniqueKey, groupId, ownerId?)`, queue-scoped
`notify`/`notifyBatch`/`waitForJob`, DLQ delegates, counters, `drain(queue)`, and
`obliterate(queue)`. Their implementations are split by responsibility under
`src/domain/queue/shard/`.

`ShardCounters` (exported, `shardCounters.ts:19`) + `ShardStats` interface (`shardCounters.ts:10`).

`ContextFactory` (exported, `src/application/contextFactory.ts:20`) with `ContextDependencies` / `ContextCallbacks` interfaces in `src/application/types/contextFactory.ts`.

## Data Models

See [data-model](../data-model.md) for full definitions. Most relevant here:

- `JobLocation` (`src/domain/types/queue.ts`) — discriminated union stored in `jobIndex`:
  - `{ type: 'queue'; shardIdx: number; queueName: string }`
  - `{ type: 'processing'; shardIdx: number; queueName: string }`
  - `{ type: 'completed'; queueName: string }`
  - `{ type: 'dlq'; queueName: string }`
- `QueueState` (`src/domain/types/queue.ts:7-17`) — `{ name; paused; rateLimit; rateLimitDuration; rateLimitExpiresAt; concurrencyLimit; activeCount }`, per-queue control state held in the shard's `LimiterManager`.
- `ShardStats` (`shardCounters.ts:10-17`) — `{ queuedJobs; delayedJobs; dlqJobs }`, O(1) running counters.
- `QueueManagerConfig` / `DEFAULT_CONFIG` (`src/application/types/config.ts`) — see [Configuration](#configuration).
- `EventType` enum and `JobEvent` (`src/domain/types/queue.ts`) — events broadcast via `EventsManager` on push/pull/complete/fail/pause/resume/etc.
- `JobLock` — held in `jobLocks` Map; `lock.token` and `lock.createdAt` are load-bearing for the #101 grace window.

## Business Logic / Control Flow

**Construction & recovery (`queue-manager/state.ts`):**

1. Merge config over `DEFAULT_CONFIG`; create `SqliteStorage` only if `config.dataPath` is set.
2. Allocate bounded collections from config sizes.
3. Allocate `SHARD_COUNT` shards, each with its own `RWLock` for the waiting/delayed queue and a separate `RWLock` + `Map` for processing.
4. Wire `CronScheduler` push/persist/worker-check callbacks; construct `WebhookManager`/`WorkerManager`/`EventsManager`.
5. Build `ContextFactory` from `getContextDependencies()` + `getContextCallbacks()`.
6. `bgTasks.recover(...)` reloads persisted jobs/queues; record `recoveryStats`;
   load crons; `startBackgroundTasks(...)`. Any exception after storage opens —
   including configuration validation, recovery, cron restore, or partial
   background startup — runs registered cleanup in reverse order, closes
   storage/timers/services, and rethrows the original startup error.

**Sharding:** `shardIndex(queue)` routes a queue name to a single shard; the
waiting/delayed state for that queue lives only there
(`queue-manager/state.ts`, `queue-manager/delivery.ts`). `processingShards` is
indexed by the job's _location_ (`loc.shardIdx`), captured when the job was
pulled — not re-derived from the queue name. `SHARD_COUNT` is computed once at
module load as the next power of two ≥ `navigator.hardwareConcurrency`
(fallback 4), capped at 64 (`shared/hash.ts`); `SHARD_MASK = SHARD_COUNT - 1`
enables a bitwise-AND modulo.

**Delegation pattern:** The public façade contains no operational logic. Each
capability class either builds the appropriate context through `ContextFactory`
and calls a stateless operation, or owns one cohesive orchestration concern.
Context contracts are isolated in `application/types/`, so operation modules do
not close over the concrete manager.

**Admission ownership:** `push`, `pushBatch`, and `pushFlow` reference-count
every unique target queue in `pendingQueueAdmissions` before registration can
invoke a callback or the operation can wait for a custom-ID/shard lock. All
flow queues are counted before the first `queue:created` callback. A `finally`
decrements each count after success, validation failure, lock timeout, or
persistence failure, so concurrent operations on one queue cannot release each
other's cleanup protection.

For buffered `pushBatch`, threshold auto-flush is deferred across the complete
synchronous admission loop and coalesced once when the outer scope exits. This
prevents a large batch from fragmenting into repeated threshold flushes while a
shard lock is held. Jobs still below the threshold remain buffer-owned but are
merged into SQLite-backed queries immediately; querying does not force a flush.

**ACK/FAIL with lock & recovery paths (`queue-manager/ack.ts`,
`queue-manager/delivery.ts`):** If a token is supplied and `verifyLock` fails,
the manager checks `isExpiredButOwned` (#101 grace) and
`throwIfOwnershipConflict`. Timeout failure claims record the exact
`{ jobId, startedAt, token }` while holding the processing lock. A later ACK or
FAIL for that retired generation becomes the explicit successful no-op
`{ applied: false, reason: 'already-finalized' }`; a current retry token still
applies and a wrong or missing token still fails. Batch ACKs report exact
`ignoredIndices` (plus diagnostic `ignoredIds`), so duplicate IDs remain
positionally unambiguous. A requeued non-timeout stall generation can still use
`completeStallRetriedJob` to prevent duplicate execution (Issue #33). The
retired-generation check is repeated after the processing claim to close the
validation-to-claim race. ACK, ACKB, and FAIL also revalidate the queue-bearing
processing location after extraction and before terminal publication; an
obliterate that wins this gap cannot be followed by a resurrected completion,
retry, or DLQ entry.

**Dependency flush (`queue-manager/dependency-runtime.ts`):** On job completion,
IDs accumulate in `pendingDepChecks`. `scheduleDependencyFlush` coalesces
multiple completions in a tick via `queueMicrotask`; `runDependencyFlush` loops
`processPendingDependencies` until the set drains, with a reentrancy guard
(`depFlushRunning`) and re-scheduling if new IDs arrive mid-flush.

**Obliterate (`queue-manager/control.ts`):** First commits one queue-wide SQLite
transaction for jobs/results, DLQ, flow outbox, completion proofs/pins,
telemetry, and queue/group state, then removes buffered inserts without
materializing all historical job IDs. It then clears the shard's waiting/delayed queue and DLQ and
explicitly sweeps every global index (`jobIndex`,
`completedJobs`, `completedJobsData`, `jobResults`, `jobLogs`, `jobLocks`, flow
maps, `repeatChain`, `customIdMap`), purges per-queue metrics + persisted
queue/group-state rows, and deletes processing-shard entries for the queue.
Result/log ownership indexes expose cold LRU entries without an unbounded scan.
A failure at any durable deletion step leaves all runtime state intact and a
retry is idempotent; same-ID job or DLQ generations owned by another queue are
preserved. If destruction occurs reentrantly during admission, a tombstone is
reconciled when the final admission owner exits: surviving post-destruction
state keeps the name, while a fully removed admission unregisters immediately.

**Counters and snapshots:** `incrementQueued`/`decrementQueued` keep shard totals in sync and feed `TemporalManager`. Public global/per-queue state snapshots still classify current `runAt` values so a matured delayed job cannot be counted as both delayed and ready before the periodic counter refresh. `queueStatsAggregator.ts` batches all requested queue counts into one pass over shared collections; WS/SSE count events are coalesced by `QueueCountsScheduler`.

## Concurrency & Locking

Per-shard `RWLock`s are the synchronization primitive; there is no global queue
lock. Mutations to a shard's waiting/delayed queue run inside
`withWriteLock(this.shardLocks[idx], () => { ... })` (for example
`completeStallRetriedJob` in `queue-manager/delivery.ts` and parent transitions
in `queue-manager/flow-failures.ts`, `flow-options.ts`, and `dependencies.ts`).
The processing map has its own `processingLocks[idx]`.

The documented acquisition order is `jobIndex` → `completedJobs` → `shards[N]`
→ `processingShards[N]`: read prerequisite global-index state first, then take
the shard write lock. Flow paths re-check `jobIndex.get(id)?.type` _inside_ the
shard lock as a TOCTOU guard before mutating (`queue-manager/flow-failures.ts`,
`flow-options.ts`, `dependencies.ts`).

Lock-token lifecycle (lease/heartbeat) is delegated to `lockManager`;
`QueueManager` only adds the #101 grace window. `isExpiredButOwned`
(`queue-manager/delivery.ts`) honors a late ACK only when the job is still
`processing`, the stored `lock.token` still matches, and
`job.startedAt <= lock.createdAt` (the re-lease guard: a re-pulled job has a
newer `startedAt`, so a stale token is rejected). See
[Concurrency & Locking](./concurrency-and-locking.md).

## Edge Cases & Failure Modes

- **Memory bounds / eviction.** `completedJobs`, `completedJobsData`,
  `timedOutJobs`, `retiredTimeoutLeaseTokens`, and
  `retiredCronLeaseTokens` use `BoundedSet`/`BoundedMap` sized at
  `maxCompletedJobs` (50k); `BoundedSet` evicts a **10% batch** when full.
  `depCompletions` instead holds exactly that many recent bare IDs plus proofs
  pinned by live reverse dependency edges. ACK prunes only unpinned SQLite
  rows; the last consumer release moves a pin into the recent FIFO and
  re-applies the cap. `jobResults`, `customIdMap`, `jobLogs`, and
  `perQueueMetrics` use `LRUMap`, which evicts **one** tail entry per insert at
  capacity. `jobResultQueues` and `jobLogQueues` mirror their corresponding LRU
  insertion, deletion, and eviction lifecycle, so queue ownership stays bounded
  and cold auxiliary entries can be purged safely. `jobIndex` is a plain `Map`, kept bounded indirectly: the
  `completedJobs` eviction callback deletes the corresponding `jobIndex` and
  `completedJobsData` entries. This is hot-cache eviction only: exact SQLite
  counts and completed cleanup remain database-authoritative for cold rows.
- **Stale-token / duplicate execution.** Issue #33 (lock removed but job still
  present), #75 (lock expired + requeued), and #101 (expired-but-owned grace)
  are handled in `queue-manager/ack.ts` and `delivery.ts`. Exact retired
  timeout generations reject neither the transport nor the Worker loop: their
  late ACK/FAIL receives authoritative ignored evidence, while the retry
  proceeds and emits no false local terminal event.
  Deleted `cron:` generations accept repeat delivery of only their own retired
  lease outcome; the marker is cleared before a custom ID is admitted again.
- **`removeOnComplete`.** Completed jobs with `removeOnComplete` are dropped
  from normal indexes; their bare ID is kept as recent evidence, or pinned
  while a waiting parent owns it. Recovery reconstructs ownership before
  pruning, so lowering the cap cannot strand an accepted parent. The memory
  tracker also retains the source queue in a bounded owner map, allowing
  memory-only obliterate to remove the selected queue's hidden proofs without
  touching another queue.
- **Repeat-chain leak guard.** `repeatChain` is capped at 10,000 entries; the
  oldest key is evicted past the cap (`queue-manager/context.ts`).
- **Flow-failure map leak guard.** `failedChildrenValues` /
  `ignoredChildrenFailures` are released on parent terminal completion or DLQ
  move (`queue-manager/flow-failures.ts`) and on `obliterate` / `shutdown`
  (`control.ts`, `lifecycle.ts`).
- **Cron orphan removal.** On `preventOverlap` upsert, a stale waiting cron job
  is removed by unique key so a reconnecting worker does not pick it up
  immediately (#73, `queue-manager/services.ts`).
- **Per-queue metric growth.** `perQueueMetrics` is LRU-bounded by
  `maxCustomIds` in `queue-manager/state.ts`; `obliterate` deletes the entry in
  `queue-manager/control.ts`.
- **Storage optional.** All `storage?.` calls are guarded; with no `dataPath`, the manager runs fully in-memory and recovery is a no-op.
- **`shutdown()`** clears every in-memory collection and per-shard structure
  (`queue-manager/lifecycle.ts`); it does not flush in-flight work beyond
  closing storage.

`SHARD_COUNT` is not configurable at runtime — it is derived once from `navigator.hardwareConcurrency` (power of two, capped at 64) at module load (`hash.ts:28-44`). Server-level env vars (`BUNQUEUE_DATA_PATH`, etc.) are resolved by the entrypoint and surface here as `config.dataPath`; see [Configuration & Entrypoint](./configuration.md).
