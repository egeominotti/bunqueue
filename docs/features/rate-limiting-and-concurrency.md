# Rate Limiting & Concurrency Control

> **Category:** Control · **Source:** `src/domain/queue/limiterManager.ts`, `src/domain/queue/groupLimiterManager.ts`, `src/domain/types/queue.ts`, `src/infrastructure/server/rateLimiter.ts`, `src/client/worker/workerRateLimiter.ts`, `src/client/queue/rateLimit.ts`, `src/client/queue/operations/groups.ts`, `src/client/worker/groupConcurrency.ts`

## Purpose

bunqueue throttles work at four independent layers: (1) **per-queue rate + concurrency limits** enforced server-side at pull time (`LimiterManager` + token-bucket `RateLimiter` + `ConcurrencyLimiter`), (2) **per-job-group fixed-window rate and concurrency limits** admitted by the broker (`GroupLimiterManager` or database-authoritative PostgreSQL state), (3) a **protocol-level abuse limiter** that caps raw TCP/HTTP requests per client IP (`ProtocolRateLimiter`), and (4) **worker-side limiters** in the client SDK that gate how fast a single `Worker` starts jobs (`WorkerRateLimiter`, BullMQ v5 `{max, duration}`) and how many jobs run concurrently per legacy job-data group key (`GroupConcurrencyLimiter`). These layers are orthogonal.

## Responsibilities & Scope

Owns:

- Per-queue rate limiting (token bucket, jobs per configured window) and concurrency capping, stored per-shard in `LimiterManager` (`src/domain/queue/limiterManager.ts:10`).
- Token-bucket refill math and concurrency slot accounting (`src/domain/types/queue.ts:33`, `:84`).
- Broker-authoritative per-group fixed windows, active counts, and stored local overrides (`src/domain/queue/groupLimiterManager.ts`, `src/infrastructure/persistence/postgres/groups.ts`).
- Protocol-level per-client sliding-window request limiting for TCP and HTTP (`src/infrastructure/server/rateLimiter.ts:70`).
- Worker-local rate limiting and per-group concurrency in the client SDK (`src/client/worker/workerRateLimiter.ts:12`, `src/client/worker/groupConcurrency.ts:11`).
- Queue and group rate/concurrency TCP commands, plus queue-level HTTP routes and CLI subcommands.

Does NOT own:

- The actual pull/dequeue decision and queue locking — delegated to [Job Lifecycle](./job-lifecycle.md) and [Concurrency & Locking](./concurrency-and-locking.md). Limiters are consulted inside the pull lock but don't manage it.
- Pausing/resuming queues (also lives in `LimiterManager` via `QueueState.paused`, but documented under [Job Queries & Queue Control](./job-queries-and-control.md)).
- Worker concurrency cap (`WorkerOptions.concurrency`) — that is a plain counter check in the worker poll loop, separate from the limiter classes here. See [Client SDK: Worker](./client-worker-sdk.md).
- Persistence of limit state to SQLite — write-through/recovery lives in [Persistence](./persistence.md) (`queue_state` table).

## Dependencies

Internal:

- `QueueState` / `createQueueState` / `RateLimiter` / `ConcurrencyLimiter` from `src/domain/types/queue.ts` — consumed by `LimiterManager`.
- `Shard` composes one `LimiterManager` per shard and exposes `setRateLimit` / `tryAcquireRateLimit` / `tryAcquireConcurrency` / `releaseConcurrency` through `ShardLimits` (`src/domain/queue/shard/limits.ts:7-35`).
- `QueueManager` routes limit mutations to the owning shard and writes them
  through to SQLite (`src/application/queue-manager/limits.ts`).
- Pull operations gate on the limiters (`src/application/operations/pullStateTransition.ts:104-118`); `releaseJobResources` releases the concurrency slot on terminal transitions (`src/domain/queue/shard/limits.ts:49-60`).
- `RateLimiterOptions` from `src/client/types/worker.ts:3-7` configures the worker-side limiters.

External/runtime:

- Bun only: `Date.now()` for windows, `Bun.env` for protocol-limiter defaults, `setInterval`/`setTimeout`. No external libraries, no SQLite calls inside the limiter classes themselves.

## Public Interface

### Server-side classes

- `class LimiterManager` (`src/domain/queue/limiterManager.ts:10`)
  - `getState(name): QueueState`, `isPaused(name): boolean`, `pause(name)`, `resume(name)`
  - `setRateLimit(queue, limit, durationMs?, ttlMs?): void` — creates `new RateLimiter(limit, limit / ((duration ?? 1000)/1000))`, so the limit means "`limit` per `duration` ms" (default: per second). `ttlMs` stamps `rateLimitExpiresAt = now + ttl` for broker-side auto-expiry. Non-finite / non-positive `duration`/`ttl` degrade to the defaults (1s window, permanent).
  - `clearRateLimit(queue): void` — also nulls `rateLimitDuration`/`rateLimitExpiresAt`
  - `expireRateLimitIfNeeded(queue): void` — lazy TTL check; called from the acquire path and from limit reads, so no timer exists and an expired limit can never throttle a pull
  - `tryAcquireRateLimit(queue): boolean` — `true` if no limiter is set (runs the TTL check first)
  - `getRateLimit(queue): { max; duration } | null`, `getRateLimitTtl(queue, maxJobs?): number`
  - `setConcurrency(queue, limit): void` — reuses/updates an existing `ConcurrencyLimiter`
  - `clearConcurrency(queue): void`
  - `tryAcquireConcurrency(queue): boolean` — `true` if no limiter is set
  - `releaseConcurrency(queue): void`
  - `getConcurrency(queue): number | null`, `isConcurrencyMaxed(queue): boolean`
  - `deleteQueue(queue): void`, `getQueueNames(): string[]`, `getStateMap(): Map<string, QueueState>`
- `class RateLimiter` (`src/domain/types/queue.ts:33-81`) — token bucket. `constructor(capacity, refillRate = capacity)`, `tryAcquire(): boolean`, `getTokens(): number`, `getTtl(maxJobs?)`.
- `class ConcurrencyLimiter` (`src/domain/types/queue.ts:84-119`) — `constructor(limit)`, `tryAcquire(): boolean`, `release(): void`, `getActive()`, `getLimit()`, `setLimit(limit)`.
- `class ProtocolRateLimiter` (`src/infrastructure/server/rateLimiter.ts:70`) — `constructor(config?: Partial<RateLimiterConfig>)`, `isAllowed(clientId): boolean`, `getRemaining(clientId): number`, `removeClient(clientId)`, `stop()`. Module helpers `getRateLimiter(config?)` (lazy singleton) and `stopRateLimiter()`.

### Client-side classes

- `class WorkerRateLimiter` (`src/client/worker/workerRateLimiter.ts:12`) — `constructor(limiter: RateLimiterOptions | null)`, `canProcessWithinLimit(): boolean`, `tryAcquire(): boolean`, `getAvailableSlots(): number`, `recordJobForLimiter(): void`, `getTimeUntilNextSlot(): number`, `getRateLimiterInfo()`, `rateLimit(expireTimeMs): void`, `isRateLimited(): boolean`.
- `class GroupConcurrencyLimiter` (`src/client/worker/groupConcurrency.ts:11`) — `static fromOptions(limiter): GroupConcurrencyLimiter | null`, `canProcess(job): boolean`, `increment(job)`, `decrement(job)`, `getGroupValue(job)`, `getGroupCount(group)`, `getMax()`, `getGroupKey()`, `clear()`.

### Client SDK (Queue) methods (`src/client/queue/rateLimit.ts`, surfaced by `src/client/queue/runtime/configuration.ts`)

- `setGlobalRateLimit(max: number, duration?: number)` — `max` jobs per `duration` ms (default 1000). The window is honored in both embedded and TCP modes; fire-and-forget over TCP.
- `setGlobalRateLimitAsync(max, duration?)` / `removeGlobalRateLimitAsync()` / `setGlobalConcurrencyAsync(n)` / `removeGlobalConcurrencyAsync()` — awaitable variants: resolve once the server has applied the change (no set-then-pull race).
- `removeGlobalRateLimit()`, `setGlobalConcurrency(concurrency)`, `removeGlobalConcurrency()` — fire-and-forget forms.
- `rateLimit(expireTimeMs)` — temporary throttle (`limit: 1` + broker-side `ttl`); throws on non-finite or non-positive input. The expiry lives on the broker, so it works identically embedded/TCP and survives client exit (see Edge Cases).
- `getGlobalRateLimit()` — returns `{ max, duration }` for the active queue limit, or `null`.
- `getGlobalConcurrency()` — returns the configured global cap, or `null`.
- `getRateLimitTtl(maxJobs?)` — returns the remaining temporary-limit TTL or token-bucket wait; `-2` means no rate limit.
- `isMaxed()` — reports whether all configured global-concurrency slots are currently occupied.

All four getters read the live `QueueManager` state in embedded mode and use
`GetQueueLimits` in TCP mode. Reads apply lazy rate-limit expiry before
returning, so an elapsed temporary limit is reported as absent.

### TCP commands (`src/domain/types/commands/limits.ts:27-46`, handlers `src/infrastructure/server/handlers/advanced/queue.ts:69-110`)

- `RateLimit { queue, limit, duration?, ttl? }` — `limit` validated as finite number, else error `"limit must be a finite number"`. `duration` = window ms (default 1000), `ttl` = broker-side auto-expiry ms; invalid values for either degrade to the defaults instead of failing.
- `RateLimitClear { queue }`
- `SetConcurrency { queue, limit }` — same finite-number validation.
- `ClearConcurrency { queue }`
- `GetQueueLimits { queue, maxJobs? }` — returns
  `{ data: { limits: { rateLimit, rateLimitTtl, concurrencyLimit, maxed } } }`.
- Group commands: `Set/Get/RemoveGroupRateLimit`,
  `GetGroupRateLimitTtl`, `Set/Get/RemoveGroupConcurrency`,
  `GetGroupJobsCount`, `GetGroupsJobsCount`, and `GetGroupActiveCount`.
  Every mutation and admission is server-side; see [Job Groups](./job-groups.md).

### HTTP endpoints (`src/infrastructure/server/httpRouteQueueConfig.ts:84`)

- `PUT /queues/:queue/rate-limit` — body `{ limit, duration?, ttl? }` → `RateLimit`
- `DELETE /queues/:queue/rate-limit` → `RateLimitClear`
- `PUT /queues/:queue/concurrency` — body `{ concurrency }` or `{ limit }` → `SetConcurrency`
- `DELETE /queues/:queue/concurrency` → `ClearConcurrency`
- Protocol limiter rejects raw requests with HTTP `429` + `{ ok:false, error:'Rate limit exceeded' }` (`src/infrastructure/server/http.ts:148`).

### CLI (`src/cli/commands/rateLimit.ts`)

- `rate-limit set <queue> <limit>` / `rate-limit clear <queue>`
- `concurrency set <queue> <limit>` / `concurrency clear <queue>`
- `limit` must be a positive number (jobs/sec for rate-limit, max concurrent for concurrency), else `CommandError`.

### Dashboard events emitted

`ratelimit:set`, `ratelimit:cleared`, `concurrency:set`, `concurrency:cleared` (handlers, `handlers/advanced/queue.ts:69-120`); `ratelimit:rejected`, `concurrency:rejected` (pull gate, `pullStateTransition.ts:104-112`); `ratelimit:hit` (protocol limiter, `tcp.ts:67-69`, `http.ts:141-148`).

## Data Models

See [data-model](../data-model.md) for full definitions. Most relevant shapes:

```typescript
// src/domain/types/queue.ts:7 — in-memory per-queue control state
interface QueueState {
  readonly name: string;
  paused: boolean;
  rateLimit: number | null; // bucket capacity, null = unlimited
  rateLimitDuration: number | null; // configured window ms; null = 1000
  rateLimitExpiresAt: number | null; // temporary-limit deadline; null = permanent
  concurrencyLimit: number | null; // max concurrent, null = unlimited
  activeCount: number;
}

// src/infrastructure/server/rateLimiter.ts:7 — protocol abuse limiter config
interface RateLimiterConfig {
  windowMs: number; // default 60000
  maxRequests: number; // default 10000
  cleanupIntervalMs?: number; // default 60000
}

// src/client/types/worker.ts:3 — worker limiter (BullMQ v5 compatible)
interface RateLimiterOptions {
  max: number; // jobs per window OR per-group cap when groupKey set
  duration: number; // window in ms
  groupKey?: string; // job-data field; switches max to per-group concurrency
}

interface GroupWorkerOptions {
  concurrency?: number; // per-group default; omitted = unlimited
  limit?: { max: number; duration: number }; // fixed window per group
}
```

Queue limits are persisted in `queue_state`. Per-group overrides are persisted
in SQLite schema-v36 `group_state`; embedded runtime windows are in memory.
PostgreSQL schema-v20 stores overrides, pause/manual deadlines, and live
fixed-window accounting in `bunqueue_group_state` so all brokers share the same
capacity and eligibility state.

## Business Logic / Control Flow

### Per-queue server limiting (pull path)

`tryPullFromShard` (`src/application/operations/pull.ts`) runs entirely inside the shard write lock:

1. If `state.paused`, return no job.
2. Ask `GroupScheduler` for the next ready ungrouped job or eligible
   priority/FIFO group head. Its secondary delayed heap and circular group
   rotation avoid scanning or reinserting an ineligible prefix of the
   authoritative heap.
3. `shard.tryAcquireConcurrency(queue)` atomically reserves the active slot. On miss, emit `concurrency:rejected` and return no job.
4. `shard.tryAcquireRateLimit(queue)` consumes the token only after the concurrency check; if it rejects, release the just-acquired concurrency slot because rate-limit tokens have no rollback operation.
5. Pop the selected job and keep its concurrency slot for the entire active
   lifetime. For grouped work, atomically acquire the effective group budget,
   increment the active group count, and advance the round-robin cursor.

Batch pull repeats the same selection and acquires **one rate token + one concurrency slot per delivered job**. The concurrency slot is released only when the job exits the active state — ack, fail-to-DLQ, stall handling, lock expiry, and the claim operations — all routed through `shard.releaseJobResources` → `releaseConcurrency`. Each release also notifies the same queue, so a long-poll waiter blocked by the cap retries immediately; another queue sharing the shard cannot consume that wake-up.

Group rate limits use fixed windows rather than the queue token bucket. A Worker
must provide `group.limit` to enable them; a stored group override replaces that
default for its ID. Likewise `group.concurrency` enables server-side per-group
active capacity and a stored concurrency override replaces that default. Both
defaults are unlimited when omitted. Group rate tokens are consumed only after
a candidate passes queue-level admission; active capacity is released on every
active exit while the fixed-window token remains consumed.

**Token bucket math** (`LimiterManager.setRateLimit`, `src/domain/queue/limiterManager.ts:54-62`; `RateLimiter.refill`, `src/domain/types/queue.ts:55-62`): capacity is `limit`, while refill rate is `limit / (durationMs / 1000)` tokens per second. On each `tryAcquire`, elapsed-time tokens are added up to the capacity and one token is consumed when available. The queue can burst up to `limit` jobs and then sustains exactly `limit` starts per configured window (one second when `duration` is omitted). The bucket is consumed at pull time, not at completion.

### Mutation + persistence

`QueueManager.setRateLimit/setConcurrency` (and their clears) route to the
owning shard's `LimiterManager`, then call `persistQueueState`
(`application/queue-manager/limits.ts`). The persistence helper upserts the row
or deletes it when all queue policy has returned to defaults. Startup recovery
reapplies the state directly to the shard without a write-back loop
(`application/background/recovery/`).

`QueueManager.getQueueLimitStatus(queue, maxJobs?)` is the single read model
for the four public getters. It combines the configured `{max, duration}`, the
remaining TTL/cooldown, the concurrency limit, and current slot saturation
without mutating capacity except for the intentional lazy TTL expiry.

### Protocol-level limiting

Every inbound TCP frame and HTTP request first calls `getRateLimiter().isAllowed(clientId)` (`src/infrastructure/server/tcp.ts:34-103`, `src/infrastructure/server/http.ts:141-149`). `clientId` is the socket-derived id (TCP) or `x-forwarded-for`/`x-real-ip`/`'unknown'` (HTTP). `isAllowed` reads the per-client `SlidingWindowDeque` count and rejects when `count >= maxRequests` within `windowMs`; otherwise it records the timestamp (`src/infrastructure/server/rateLimiter.ts:81-100`). On disconnect, `removeClient` drops the client's deque (`src/infrastructure/server/tcp/connections.ts:87-97`, `src/infrastructure/server/http.ts:237-240`). The singleton is torn down via `stopRateLimiter()` on shutdown (`src/infrastructure/server/bootstrap.ts:234-237`).

### Worker-side rate limiting

In the worker state constructor (`src/client/worker/runtime/state.ts`):

```typescript
this.rateLimiter = new WorkerRateLimiter(opts.limiter?.groupKey ? null : (opts.limiter ?? null));
this.groupLimiter = GroupConcurrencyLimiter.fromOptions(opts.limiter);
```

Key invariant: **if `limiter.groupKey` is set, the `WorkerRateLimiter` is disabled** and `limiter.max` instead becomes a per-group concurrency cap. A single `limiter` option is therefore _either_ a global rate limit _or_ a per-group concurrency limit, never both.

- `poll()` and `tryProcess()` (`worker/runtime/polling.ts`) check availability
  before pulling. `doPullBatch()` also caps the requested batch by
  `getAvailableSlots() - pendingPull`, so concurrent pulls cannot lease more
  work than the current budget.
- `startJob()` performs the authoritative synchronous `tryAcquire()` immediately
  before dispatch. The token records a **job start** and is never consumed at
  completion; success, failure, retry attempts and long-running jobs therefore
  obey the same rolling start-time window.
- `processJobManually()` uses the same admission boundary after checking worker
  concurrency, duplicate job ids and group capacity. A waiting manual lease is
  returned to the broker if the worker closes before admission.
- `getTimeUntilNextSlot()` returns the longer of the rolling-window wait and a
  temporary override wait, while retaining O(1) access to the oldest live token.
- `Worker.rateLimit(expireTimeMs)` sets that independent temporary override. It
  works without a configured rolling limiter and in `groupKey` mode, and does
  not inject synthetic timestamps into the rolling window.

### Worker-side group concurrency

`GroupConcurrencyLimiter` (`src/client/worker/groupConcurrency.ts`) tracks `activeByGroup: Map<groupValue, count>`:

- `getGroupValue(job)` reads `job.data[groupKey]`; `null`/`undefined`/missing → `null` (not subject to the limit); strings are used as-is and other values are stringified with template-literal conversion (numbers, booleans, bigint, arrays and ordinary objects keep their historical keys, e.g. `42`, `true`, `1,b`, `[object Object]`).
- `getGroupValue` is **total** (never throws): the ACK frontier, buffered
  admission (`canProcess`) and the `increment`/`decrement` pair all call it on
  producer-controlled data. A value whose conversion throws — e.g.
  `{ toString: 'x' }`, valid JSON/msgpack, a null-prototype object, a symbol, or
  an array containing such a value — falls back to
  `Object.prototype.toString.call(value)` (`[object Object]`, `[object Symbol]`,
  `[object Array]`); if that or the property read itself throws, the constant
  `[bunqueue:unprintable-group-value]` is used. The fallback is deterministic,
  so the same job always maps to the same group and counts stay balanced; the
  limit still applies to such jobs (they may share a group with other values
  that stringify to the same tag).
- `canProcess(job)` → `current < maxPerGroup` (jobs without a group always pass).
- `getNextEligibleJob()` (`worker/runtime/buffer.ts`) scans for the first group
  with capacity. `startJob()` in `runtime/execution.ts` owns the exactly-once
  increment/decrement pair.
- **Group pull-ahead exception** (`worker/runtime/polling.ts`): when the buffer
  is non-empty but every buffered group is blocked, the leased count uses
  `activeJobs` so the worker may discover another runnable group.

## Concurrency & Locking

- Server per-queue rate/concurrency checks (`tryAcquireRateLimit`, `tryAcquireConcurrency`, `releaseConcurrency`) run **inside the shard write lock** held during pull (`pull.ts:255`), so check-and-acquire is atomic with respect to other pullers on the same shard. There is no separate limiter lock; the limiter state lives within the shard's lock domain. See the lock hierarchy in [Concurrency & Locking](./concurrency-and-locking.md).
- `LimiterManager` and its `RateLimiter`/`ConcurrencyLimiter` are single-threaded JS objects with no internal locking; safety comes entirely from the surrounding shard lock.
- The acquire-at-pull / release-at-terminal pattern means a slot is held for the full active lifetime of a job. Any exit path that forgets to call `releaseJobResources` would leak a concurrency slot; all known paths (ack, fail, stall, lock-expiry, cancel, obliterate-time release, and the management claim ops `moveActiveToWait`/`moveToWaitingChildren`/`moveJobToDelayed`/`discardJob`) route through it (repro: `test/repro-slot-release-claim-paths.test.ts`).
- `ProtocolRateLimiter`, `WorkerRateLimiter`, and `GroupConcurrencyLimiter` are not lock-protected; each is owned by a single connection/worker context.

## Edge Cases & Failure Modes

- **Default = unlimited per queue.** No `RateLimiter`/`ConcurrencyLimiter` exists until explicitly set; `tryAcquire*` returns `true` when absent (`limiterManager.ts:63`, `:90`). The only always-on throttle is the protocol limiter at 10000 req/60s per client (the known "rate limit defaults to Infinity" caveat refers to per-queue limits being off by default).
- **`setGlobalRateLimit(max, duration)` honors `duration` end-to-end** (client → wire `duration` field → `LimiterManager` refill rate), matching BullMQ's `{max per duration}` semantics in both modes. Servers older than 2.8.35 ignore the field and fall back to the 1s bucket. The worker-side `WorkerRateLimiter` independently honors its own `{max, duration}`.
- The official TypeScript and Python network SDKs forward the same custom
  window as wire `duration`; omitting it preserves the broker's 1,000 ms
  default. Real-broker regressions read the applied window through
  `GetQueueLimits` so a silently dropped field cannot pass.
- **`Queue.rateLimit(expireTimeMs)` expires broker-side** (`rateLimit.ts`): both modes set `limit: 1` with a broker-side `ttl`; there is no client timer, so the expiry survives client exit and behaves identically embedded/TCP. Lazy expiry: the limit clears on the first pull or limit read past the deadline. During the window jobs still trickle at 1/sec (token refill), matching the previous approximation. Invalid `expireTimeMs` (non-finite or ≤ 0) throws. A TTL'd limit persisted to `queue_state` is restored with its remaining time on restart and never resurrects once expired.
- **TTL sentinel:** `getRateLimitTtl` returns `-2` when no rate limit exists. A temporary limit returns its remaining broker-side lifetime; a permanent token bucket returns the wait required for the requested token count.
- **`isMaxed` scope:** it reflects the global concurrency limiter, not worker-local concurrency or rate-token availability. With no configured global concurrency it is `false`.
- **Memory bounds.**
  - `SlidingWindowDeque` advances a head pointer for O(1) amortized expiry and compacts the array when `head > 1000` (`rateLimiter.ts:36`); the cleanup interval deletes empty per-client deques every `cleanupIntervalMs` (`rateLimiter.ts:130`). The maintenance timer is unreferenced: it continues while TCP/HTTP work keeps the process alive but cannot prevent a stopped broker from exiting. Request-time lazy expiry remains authoritative, so timer scheduling never changes admission correctness.
  - `WorkerRateLimiter.evictExpired` advances head and compacts when more than half the token array is dead space (`workerRateLimiter.ts:108`).
  - `GroupConcurrencyLimiter.decrement` deletes a group's map entry once its count hits 0, so idle groups don't accumulate (`groupConcurrency.ts:74`).
- **Negative/non-positive limits:** CLI rejects `limit <= 0`; TCP handlers only require a finite number, so `RateLimit limit:0` would create a token bucket that never refills enough to grant a token (effectively blocks the queue). `ConcurrencyLimiter` with limit `0` blocks all pulls.
- **Batch pull partial fill:** if rate or concurrency runs out mid-batch, `tryDequeueNextJob` returns `stop`; the batch loop breaks and returns the jobs gathered so far (`pullStateTransition.ts:104-112`, `pull.ts:268-279`) — never an error.
- **Slot release on requeue:** a failed processing handoff triggers `requeueJob`, which releases the concurrency slot and group slot before pushing the job back, preventing a permanent slot leak on transient pull failures (`pullStateTransition.ts:139-169`).
- **Worker rate tokens represent starts:** admission consumes exactly one token
  before the processor is invoked. Completion does not release or add a token;
  capacity returns only when the recorded start leaves the rolling window.

## Configuration

Protocol-level limiter (`src/infrastructure/server/rateLimiter.ts:13`):

| Env var                   | Default | Meaning                                |
| ------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS`    | 60000   | Sliding window size per client         |
| `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS` | 10000   | Max raw requests per client per window |
| `RATE_LIMIT_CLEANUP_MS`   | 60000   | Interval to evict idle client deques   |

Per-queue limits are runtime-set (TCP/HTTP/CLI/SDK), persisted in `queue_state`, and have no env defaults (unset = unlimited).

Worker-local limits are set via `WorkerOptions.limiter: { max, duration,
groupKey? }`. `WorkerOptions.group` is a separate broker-authoritative job-group
policy. `WorkerOptions.concurrency` (default 1) is the Worker's own parallelism
cap and does not replace either server limit.
