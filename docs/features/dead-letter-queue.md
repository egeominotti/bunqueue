# Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)

> **Category:** Jobs · **Source:** `src/domain/queue/dlqShard.ts`, `src/application/dlqManager.ts`, `src/application/dlqRetry.ts`, `src/domain/types/dlq.ts`, `src/client/queue/dlq.ts`, `src/client/queue/dlqOps.ts`, `src/client/queue/dlqJobMethods.ts`

## Purpose

The Dead Letter Queue is the terminal sink for jobs that can no longer make progress: they exhausted their retry attempts, timed out during processing, were explicitly discarded, stalled past `maxStalls`, lost their lock, or had a parent fail because a child failed. Each DLQ entry preserves the original `Job` plus failure metadata (reason, error, attempt history, timestamps) so operators can inspect, filter, retry, or purge dead jobs. The DLQ also supports optional time-based auto-retry with exponential backoff and age-based auto-purge, both driven by a periodic background task.

## Responsibilities & Scope

What this module owns:

- In-memory per-queue storage of `DlqEntry[]` (`DlqShard`, one instance per `Shard`) and per-queue `DlqConfig` / `StallConfig`.
- Building `DlqEntry` metadata from a failed `Job` (`createDlqEntry`), enforcing `maxEntries` (oldest-first eviction).
- Reading/filtering entries (`getEntries`, `getFiltered`, `getDlqStats`), permanently removing a selected job, clearing a queue.
- Re-queuing dead jobs back to their `PriorityQueue` (`retryDlqJob`, `retryDlqJobs`, `retryDlqByFilter`, `processAutoRetry`).
- Lifecycle policy: expiry detection (`isDlqEntryExpired`), auto-retry eligibility (`canAutoRetry`), retry scheduling with exponential backoff (`scheduleNextRetry`).
- Client SDK surface for embedded and TCP modes (`Queue.getDlq/retryDlq/purgeDlq/...`).

What it does NOT own (delegated elsewhere):

- **Deciding when a job enters the DLQ.** That lives in the fail/stall/lock/recovery paths (`src/application/operations/ack/`, `stallDetection.ts`, `lockManager.ts`, `background/recovery/`, `queue-manager/flow-failures.ts`). The DLQ only exposes `addToDlq`. See [Job Lifecycle](./job-lifecycle.md).
- **Persistence.** Local writes/reads of the SQLite `dlq` table are owned by [Persistence](./persistence.md) (`saveDlqEntry`, `deleteDlqEntry`, `clearDlqQueue`, `loadDlq`). PostgreSQL terminal and retry transactions are owned by the [multi-broker store](./postgres-multibroker.md).
- **The 60s maintenance scheduling loop** itself — owned by [Background Tasks](./background-tasks.md) (`performDlqMaintenance`).
- **Stall detection / lock expiry logic** — see [Rate Limiting & Concurrency](./rate-limiting-and-concurrency.md) and [Background Tasks](./background-tasks.md). `DlqShard` only stores the `StallConfig`.

## Dependencies

Internal:

- [Core Queue Engine](./core-queue-engine.md) — `Shard` wraps `DlqShard` and exposes `addToDlq`, `getDlqEntries`, `removeFromDlq`, `clearDlq`, etc.; `dlqManager.ts` reaches the queue via `Shard.getQueue()` and `Shard.incrementQueued()` to re-enqueue.
- [Data Structures](./data-structures.md) — re-queued jobs are pushed back into the `PriorityQueue`.
- [Persistence](./persistence.md) — `SqliteStorage.saveDlqEntry/deleteDlqEntry/clearDlqQueue/loadDlq/insertJob/updateForRetry`.
- `src/shared/hash.ts` — `shardIndex(queue)` selects the owning shard.
- [Client SDK: Queue](./client-queue-sdk.md) — `dlq.ts` / `dlqOps.ts` form the client surface; `manager.ts` resolves the shared embedded manager.

External/runtime:

- Memory/SQLite uses Bun's `bun:sqlite`; PostgreSQL uses Bun's native `SQL`
  client. DLQ payloads are MessagePack encoded with `msgpackr`, the package's
  only third-party runtime dependency.

## Public Interface

### `DlqShard` (`src/domain/queue/dlqShard.ts`)

```typescript
class DlqShard {
  constructor(stats: DlqStatsCallback);
  getConfig(queue: string): DlqConfig;
  setConfig(queue: string, config: Partial<DlqConfig>): void;
  getStallConfig(queue: string): StallConfig;
  setStallConfig(queue: string, config: Partial<StallConfig>): void;
  add(job: Job, reason?: FailureReason, error?: string | null): DlqEntry;
  restoreEntry(queue: string, entry: DlqEntry): void;
  getEntries(queue: string): DlqEntry[];
  getJobs(queue: string, count?: number): Job[];
  getFiltered(queue: string, filter: DlqFilter): DlqEntry[];
  remove(queue: string, jobId: JobId): DlqEntry | null;
  removeAll(queue: string, jobId: JobId): DlqEntry[];
  getAutoRetryEntries(queue: string, now?: number): DlqEntry[];
  getExpiredEntries(queue: string, now?: number): DlqEntry[];
  purgeExpired(queue: string, now?: number): number;
  clear(queue: string): number;
  getCount(queue: string): number;
  getQueueNames(): string[];
  deleteQueue(queue: string): number;
}
```

### Application functions (`src/application/dlqManager.ts`, `dlqRetry.ts`)

`dlqManager.ts` owns reads, statistics, configuration, purge and completed-job retry. `dlqRetry.ts` owns `retryDlqJob`, `retryDlqJobs`, `retryDlqByFilter`, and `processAutoRetry`; the split isolates retry transitions and keeps both modules below 300 lines. All operations take a `DlqContext { shards, jobIndex, jobResults, dependencyResults, customIdMap, jobLogs, storage }` (or `RetryCompletedContext`). `storage` is **required (nullable)**: every builder passes it or explicit `null`, so persistence cannot silently disappear. The auxiliary stores are required because permanent removal clears all terminal ownership, not only the shard entry.

### Domain helpers (`src/domain/types/dlq.ts`)

`createDlqEntry`, `addAttemptRecord`, `isDlqEntryExpired`, `canAutoRetry`, `scheduleNextRetry`; enum `FailureReason`; `DEFAULT_DLQ_CONFIG`.

### Client SDK (`src/client/queue/queue.ts` → `dlq.ts` → `dlqOps.ts`)

```typescript
queue.setDlqConfig(config: Partial<DlqConfig>): void
queue.getDlqConfig(): DlqConfig
queue.getDlqConfigAsync(): Promise<DlqConfig>
queue.getDlq(filter?: DlqFilter): DlqEntry<T>[]      // embedded only
queue.getDlqAsync(filter?: DlqFilter): Promise<DlqEntry<T>[]>
queue.getDlqJobsAsync(count?: number): Promise<Job<T>[]>
queue.getDlqStats(): DlqStats                        // embedded snapshot
queue.getDlqStatsAsync(): Promise<DlqStats>
queue.retryDlq(id?: string): number
queue.retryDlqAsync(id?: string): Promise<number>
queue.retryDlqByFilter(filter: DlqFilter): number    // TCP fire-and-forget; returns 0 remotely
queue.retryDlqByFilterAsync(filter: DlqFilter): Promise<number>
queue.purgeDlq(): number
queue.purgeDlqAsync(): Promise<number>
queue.removeDlqJob(id: string): Promise<boolean>
queue.removeDlqJobAsync(id: string): Promise<boolean>
queue.retryCompleted(id?: string): number
queue.retryCompletedAsync(id?: string): Promise<number>
queue.retryJobs(opts?: {
  state?: 'failed' | 'completed'; count?: number; timestamp?: number
}): Promise<void>
```

The synchronous read/count-returning methods cannot return a remote response and
remain embedded snapshots or TCP fire-and-forget forms. The async variants are
authoritative in both runtimes. Every `job` nested in a `DlqEntry` is constructed
with the live callbacks from `dlqJobMethods.ts`; all 32 non-serialization `Job`
methods therefore reach the embedded manager or TCP broker instead of returning
placeholder values.

### TCP commands handled

- `Dlq` → `handleDlq` (`src/infrastructure/server/handlers/dlq.ts`) — accepts `count?` and `filter?`, returning both raw jobs and full entries with failure metadata.
- `GetDlqStats` → `handleGetDlqStats` — returns authoritative aggregate statistics.
- `RetryDlq` → `handleRetryDlq` — retries one (`jobId`), a bounded batch (`count`), or entries selected by `filter`; emits `dlq:retried` / `dlq:retry-all`.
- `PurgeDlq` → `handlePurgeDlq` (`:41`) — clears the queue's DLQ; emits `dlq:purged`.
- `RemoveDlqJob` → `handleRemoveDlqJob` — permanently removes the selected entry and returns `data.removed`; a missing entry is a successful, idempotent `false` result.
- `RetryCompleted` → `handleRetryCompleted` — accepts `id?`, `count?`, and `timestamp?` and returns the applied count.
- `GetDlqConfig` / `SetDlqConfig` → `handleGetDlqConfig` / `handleSetDlqConfig` (`src/infrastructure/server/handlers/advanced/queue.ts:172` for GetDlqConfig, `:153` for SetDlqConfig).

Dispatched in `src/infrastructure/server/handler-routes/control.ts:112-128`. See [TCP Server Command Handlers](./tcp-server-handlers.md).

### HTTP endpoints (`src/infrastructure/server/httpRouteQueueConfig.ts`)

These expose the same manager operations and command handlers: DLQ-stats and entry reads, `RetryDlq`, `PurgeDlq`, `GetDlqConfig`, and `SetDlqConfig` (`httpRouteQueueConfig.ts:28-81`, `httpRouteQueueConfig.ts:153-172`); `RetryCompleted` is routed in `httpRouteQueues.ts:132-141`. See [HTTP / REST / SSE / WebSocket API](./http-api.md).

### Dashboard events emitted

`dlq:added`, `dlq:retried`, `dlq:retry-all`, `dlq:purged`, `dlq:auto-retried`, `dlq:expired`, plus `flow:failed` for parent/child flows. See [Webhooks, Events & Job Logs](./webhooks-and-events.md).

## Data Models

Full definitions in [data-model](../data-model.md). The key shape (`src/domain/types/dlq.ts:43`):

```typescript
interface DlqEntry {
  readonly job: Job; // original job (data + options preserved)
  readonly enteredAt: number; // when first moved to DLQ
  readonly reason: FailureReason; // last failure reason
  readonly error: string | null;
  readonly attempts: AttemptRecord[]; // attempt history
  retryCount: number; // times retried *from* the DLQ (auto-retry)
  lastRetryAt: number | null;
  nextRetryAt: number | null; // null = no auto-retry scheduled
  readonly expiresAt: number | null; // null = never auto-purge
}
```

`FailureReason` (`:9`): `explicit_fail`, `max_attempts_exceeded`, `timeout`, `stalled`, `ttl_expired`, `worker_lost`, `unknown` (const enum, string-valued).

`DlqConfig` (`:65`) with `DEFAULT_DLQ_CONFIG` (`:79`): `autoRetry: false`, `autoRetryInterval: 3_600_000` (1h), `maxAutoRetries: 3`, `maxAge: 604_800_000` (7d, `null` = never), `maxEntries: 10000`.

`DlqFilter` (`:168`): `reason`, `queue`, `olderThan`, `newerThan`, `retriable`, `expired`, `limit`, `offset`. `DlqStats` (`:188`): `total`, `byReason`, `byQueue`, `pendingRetry`, `expired`, `oldestEntry`, `newestEntry`.

SQLite `dlq` table (`src/infrastructure/persistence/schema.ts:73`): `id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, job_id TEXT NOT NULL, queue TEXT NOT NULL, entry BLOB NOT NULL, entered_at INTEGER NOT NULL`. The `entry` BLOB is the msgpack-packed `DlqEntry`. Indexed on `queue`, `job_id`, `entered_at`. Note: `job_id` is **not** UNIQUE.

## Business Logic / Control Flow

### Entering the DLQ

`DlqShard` only stores entries; callers decide eligibility. Entry paths publish the shard entry and index, persist the DLQ row, and delete the live `jobs` row while ownership remains synchronous. Explicit discard performs those writes while still holding the shard lock, so selective removal cannot observe the in-memory entry and then race a late durable insert. Entry points:

1. **Processor failure at max attempts** — `moveFailedJobToDlq` (`src/application/operations/ack/failure.ts`), terminal branch of `failJob`. Ordinary processor failures use `MaxAttemptsExceeded`; their prior retryable attempts are recorded as `ExplicitFail`. Emits `dlq:added`.
2. **Processing timeout** — `checkJobTimeouts` (`src/application/background/timeouts.ts`) invokes the same failure transition with an explicit `Timeout` classification. Retryable and terminal timeout attempts therefore remain `Timeout`, including after SQLite recovery. A subsequent ordinary processor failure is classified normally and is not contaminated by the earlier timeout marker.
3. **Explicit discard** — `discardJob` (`src/application/operations/jobManagement.ts`). Default reason `Unknown`.
4. **Stall (runtime)** — `moveStalliedJobToDlq` (`src/application/stallDetection.ts`) when `stallCount >= maxStalls`. Reason `Stalled`. Cron `preventOverlap` jobs are dropped instead.
5. **Lock expiry** — `handleMaxStallsExceeded` (`src/application/lockManager.ts`). Reason `Stalled`.
6. **Startup recovery** — `recover` (`src/application/background/recovery/`) classifies interrupted active work and quarantines corrupt dependency metadata.
7. **Flow parent failure** — `moveParentToFailed` (`src/application/queue-manager/flow-failures.ts`) routes a parent whose child failed; reason `Unknown` with a `Child job <id> failed: …` message.

Retryable failures accumulate as `AttemptRecord`s in a non-enumerable `DlqRetryState` on the live `Job`, persisted in `jobs.dlq_retry_state`. Clearing it (`setDlqRetryState(job, null)`, on completion, DLQ entry and manual retry) assigns `undefined` instead of deleting the property, so a retried job keeps a shared hidden class; a delete gave each such job a hidden class (Structure) and, once serialized, a property-name cache of its own (~1 KB per retained job). The cleared property stays visible as `undefined` to `console.log`/`Bun.inspect` and `Object.getOwnPropertySymbols` on the internal Job; JSON, MessagePack, persistence and the wire are unaffected. `createDlqEntry` appends the terminal attempt. On first entry it sets `enteredAt = now`, schedules `nextRetryAt` when auto-retry is enabled, and derives `expiresAt` from `maxAge` (`0` = immediately expired, `null` = never). A failure after automatic redelivery reuses the original entry time, expiry, history, retry count, and scheduled backoff.

`FailureReason` also contains `ttl_expired` and `worker_lost` as reserved wire-compatible categories. Current TTL handling drops an expired waiting job when it is pulled, and disconnect recovery uses the stall/lock path, so neither reserved value is currently emitted as a terminal DLQ reason.

`add()` (`dlqShard.ts:66`) enforces `maxEntries` by shifting the oldest entry (FIFO) while `entries.length >= config.maxEntries` (`:81-84`), decrementing the DLQ counter for each eviction, then pushes and increments.

### Querying

`getFiltered` (`dlqShard.ts:125`) applies the filter predicates in-memory: `reason`, `olderThan`/`newerThan` (compared against `enteredAt`), `retriable` (via `canAutoRetry`), `expired` (via `isDlqEntryExpired`), then `offset`/`limit` slicing. `getDlqStats` (`dlqManager.ts:42`) tallies counts by reason, `pendingRetry` (`nextRetryAt <= now && retryCount < maxAutoRetries`), `expired`, and oldest/newest timestamps.

The TCP `Dlq` handler applies the same filter before serializing entries, and
`GetDlqStats` exposes the same aggregate. `getDlqAsync` converts each returned
entry through `toDlqEntry` with a complete live-method context; failure reason,
attempt history, timestamps, and the operational public `Job` survive the wire
round trip.

### Manual retry

`retryDlqJob` (`dlqRetry.ts`) first verifies that the job is still the selected
DLQ generation and that neither its custom ID nor its unique key belongs to a
different live job. A conflict returns `0` and leaves the terminal entry
unchanged. It then creates a waiting snapshot, clears its automatic-retry
generation, resets `attempts`, `runAt`, `startedAt`, `stallCount`, and
`lastHeartbeat`, and appends a bounded `waiting` timeline entry.

SQLite commits `requeueDlqJob(job)` before RAM is changed. That transaction
atomically deletes the old DLQ row and inserts the waiting job; only after it
succeeds does the application remove the in-memory entry and publish the heap,
counter, `jobIndex`, custom-ID ownership, unique-key ownership, and notification.
A rejected write therefore leaves both memory and disk terminal. The `jobs` row
was deleted on DLQ entry, so the re-insert is essential for restart safety.

Every single, bounded, all-entry, filtered, and automatic retry uses this same
per-entry transition. An all-entry retry deliberately does not clear the DLQ
up front: a later conflict or storage error cannot lose entries that were not
committed. With an optional `limit` (the `RetryDlq` command's `count`, surfaced
client-side as `queue.retryJobs({ state:'failed', count })`) it retries only the
first `limit` entries, leaving the remainder in the DLQ. `retryDlqByFilter`
applies the same transition to the filtered entries.

### Permanent selective removal

`removeDlqJob(queue, id)` deletes a failed job without re-enqueuing it. The
SQLite transaction runs first; only after it succeeds does `DlqShard.removeAll`
drop every recovered in-memory duplicate and decrement the counter by the exact
number removed. Terminal ownership cleanup covers `jobIndex`, results, logs,
dependency-result consumers, the guarded custom-ID mapping, pending buffered
rows, durable jobs/results, and parent-owned `flow_failures`. If the same ID
already belongs to a newer live generation, only the stale `(queue, jobId)` DLQ
rows are deleted. Repeating the call returns `false`; a storage or broker error
throws and leaves the entry authoritative.

### Auto-retry (background, opt-in)

`processAutoRetry` (`dlqRetry.ts`) runs only if `config.autoRetry`. For each due
entry it advances a cloned retry schedule, persists the waiting snapshot, and
only then replaces the terminal in-memory generation. A failed write cannot
mutate the DLQ entry's retry metadata. A terminal re-failure reconstructs the
same chain instead of resetting it. Backoff is
`autoRetryInterval * 2^(retryCount-1)`; `nextRetryAt` becomes `null` at
`maxAutoRetries`.

### Auto-purge + maintenance loop

`performDlqMaintenance` (`src/application/background/dlq.ts`) iterates every cached queue name, calls `processAutoRetry` then `purgeExpiredDlq`, and emits `dlq:auto-retried` / `dlq:expired`. `purgeExpiredDlq` (`dlqManager.ts`) uses one timestamp to snapshot and remove exactly the same expired entries. Both expiration and explicit `purgeDlqJobs` then remove each terminal job from `jobIndex`, results, logs, dependency-result ownership, guarded custom-ID ownership, the WriteBuffer, `jobs`, `job_results`, parent-owned `flow_failures`, and `dlq`. SQLite deletion is one transaction (`SqliteStorage.purgeDlqEntries`); an all-queue purge clears only that queue's DLQ rows, while expiration deletes only the captured `(queue, jobId)` pairs. If the ID already identifies a newer live generation, only its stale DLQ row is removed: the current job row, buffer entry, auxiliary state, and index survive. This prevents a purged terminal job from remaining observable as `failed` or resurrecting after restart without affecting another queue or a retried/recreated job. The interval is registered in `background/lifecycle.ts` from `ctx.config.dlqMaintenanceMs`; the default is **60_000 ms** (`src/application/types/config.ts`).

### `retryCompleted`

`retryCompletedJobs` in `application/completedRetry.ts` is a sibling, **not** a
DLQ operation. With persistence, a specific ID uses a primary-key SQLite read
constrained by `state='completed'`; nullable `completed_at` is ordering metadata,
not the state discriminator. Bulk
retry keyset-pages SQLite in bounded 500-row `(completed timestamp,id)` order,
oldest first, so completions evicted from the hot cache remain reachable without
materializing the full table. Memory-only mode scans the bounded map. It creates
a fresh waiting-generation snapshot, resets
attempts, progress/message, processing/completion timestamps, and the heartbeat,
while preserving the diagnostic stacktrace and bounded timeline before appending
the new `waiting` entry. `SqliteStorage.requeueCompletedJob` changes the durable
state and deletes the prior `job_results` row in one synchronous transaction;
only after that succeeds are completed/result ownership, the heap, `jobIndex`,
custom-ID ownership, unique-key ownership, and counters changed in memory. The
same generation and ownership preflight used by DLQ retry rejects a retry when
another live job owns the unique key. A rejected SQLite write therefore leaves
the completed generation authoritative, and a successful retry cannot expose
the old `returnvalue`, accept a duplicate custom ID as new work, or recover
completed metadata after restart. Selection accepts an optional job id,
non-negative `limit`, and terminal `timestamp` cutoff. This keeps
`queue.retryJobs({ state: 'completed', count, timestamp })` consistent in
memory-only, persisted embedded, and TCP deployments.

## Concurrency & Locking

`DlqShard` itself is single-threaded data (Bun is single-threaded per process); its methods take no locks. Locking is the caller's job and follows the documented hierarchy (`jobIndex` → `completedJobs` → `shards[N]` → `processingShards[N]`):

- `moveFailedJobToDlq` runs inside `failJob`'s `withWriteLock(shardLocks[idx])` after the processing-shard lock released the job (`src/application/operations/ack/failure.ts:71-75`, `:99-138`).
- `moveParentToFailed` (`queue-manager/flow-failures.ts`) acquires the shard write lock and **re-checks `jobIndex.get(parentId)?.type === 'queue'` inside the lock** — a TOCTOU guard preventing two concurrent child-failure callbacks from creating duplicate DLQ entries for the same parent.
- `discardJob` takes the queue or processing lock to extract the job, then a
  separate shard write lock to add and synchronously persist the DLQ entry,
  delete the live row, and release terminal dependency/custom-ID ownership.
  No `await` occurs inside that critical section.
- The maintenance task and `getDlq*` reads are not lock-protected, consistent with the cooperative single-thread model; auto-retry mutates entries it owns before removing them.

In PostgreSQL, DLQ eviction, expiry, removal, purge, and retry use the shared
dependency-safe destructive lock plan. Limit/expiry enforcement runs in its own
canonical transaction after the terminal transition commits; this avoids
acquiring a dependency advisory lock while already holding a terminal job row.
The revalidated cleanup skips a producer with an external live consumer, and a
later maintenance pass can enforce the bound after that consumer is gone.
Automatic retry first discovers candidate consumers and dependency edges without
row locks. Its transaction then locks current queue policies, all consumer and
dependency identities in sorted order, and finally the candidate rows. It
rechecks dependency edges and skips any late unprotected edge before consulting
completion evidence. This ordering serializes completion-tombstone retirement
with custom-ID generation reuse and lets multiple brokers converge on exactly
one retry without a row/advisory lock inversion.

## Edge Cases & Failure Modes

- **`maxEntries` overflow** — normalized to a positive integer (minimum 1), default 10,000. `add()`, `restoreEntry()`, and lowering the configured cap evict oldest-first FIFO. Each eviction updates the counter, clears terminal index/result/log ownership, and deletes durable DLQ/job/result rows, so memory and SQLite stay bounded across restarts.
- **Orphan `jobs` row / UNIQUE on retry (#97)** — every DLQ-entry path must persist the terminal entry and delete the live row. `lockManager.ts` documents this explicitly: if the lock-expiry path skipped these writes, the `jobs` row survived in SQLite while the DLQ entry lived only in memory, and a later retry re-inserted the surviving row → `UNIQUE constraint failed: jobs.id`. Symmetrically, retry paths call `requeueDlqJob`, whose SQLite transaction deletes the terminal row and inserts the live row together (`persistence/sqlite/jobs.ts`).
- **`deleteJob` does not cascade the DLQ** — by design (`persistence/sqlite/mutations.ts`): `moveFailedJobToDlq` writes the DLQ row then drops the `jobs` row; cleanup callers that genuinely want the DLQ gone must call `deleteDlqEntry` explicitly.
- **Purge is a full terminal deletion** — clearing only `DlqShard`/the `dlq` table leaves a dangling `jobIndex` location, so `GetState` still reports `failed`. `purgeDlqJobs` and `purgeExpiredDlq` share the same cleanup path and transactionally remove durable job/result rows plus pending buffered inserts before dropping the global indexes. Repeating expiry cleanup is a no-op, and purging one queue cannot delete another queue's entries.
- **PostgreSQL protected producers** — manual removal returns `false`, while
  bulk purge, expiry, and `maxEntries` enforcement skip a DLQ job that still has
  a live dependency consumer outside the same deletion set. The DLQ row and its
  counters remain coherent until deletion becomes legal.
- **Recovery double-count avoidance** — `recover` loads `loadDlqJobIds()` and `recoverActiveJobs` skips stale `active` rows already present in the DLQ (legacy DBs predate the failJob fix), dropping the orphan row (`background/recovery/active.ts`). `quarantineCorruptDependsOn` persists the entry and drops the row but deliberately does **not** add to in-memory DLQ — the later `restoreDlq` pass restores it exactly once (`background/recovery/shared.ts`, `restore.ts`).
- **`job_id` is not UNIQUE in the `dlq` table** — `insertDlq` is a plain `INSERT`; `deleteDlqEntry` deletes every matching row and `loadDlq` orders by `entered_at`. Selective permanent removal therefore drops every matching recovered row in one pass and decrements the in-memory counter by that exact number.
- **Choose the async remote surface** — `getDlq` and `getDlqStats` retain synchronous embedded return types, so their TCP forms cannot return broker results. Synchronous `retryDlqByFilter` does send the filtered mutation over TCP, but returns the non-authoritative value `0`. Use `getDlqAsync`, `getDlqStatsAsync`, and `retryDlqByFilterAsync`; they round-trip full entries, statistics, and filtered retry counts. `getDlqConfig` returns the client-side TCP cache or `{}`, while `getDlqConfigAsync` reads the broker.
- **Synchronous DLQ mutations are fire-and-forget in TCP mode** — `retryDlq`, `retryDlqByFilter`, and `purgeDlq` send the operation and return `0` regardless of the eventual server result. Their async counterparts return authoritative counts. `removeDlqJob` and its explicit `Async` alias are always Promise-based and reject broker errors; `false` means only that no matching entry existed.
- **Auto-retry default off** — `DEFAULT_DLQ_CONFIG.autoRetry = false`; entries created under it get `nextRetryAt = null` and are never auto-retried until config is changed. Changing config later does not retro-set `nextRetryAt` on existing entries.
- **`maxAge: null`** disables expiry (`expiresAt = null`), so entries persist until manually purged or evicted by `maxEntries`.
- **Timeline cap** — re-queue paths only push a `waiting` timeline entry while `timeline.length < MAX_TIMELINE_ENTRIES`, bounding per-job timeline growth across repeated retries.

## Configuration

DLQ behavior is per-queue via `DlqConfig` (set with `queue.setDlqConfig(...)` / `SetDlqConfig`), not via environment variables:

The effective merged configuration is written through to
`queue_state.dlq_config` as one MessagePack blob. It survives broker restart and
is restored before interrupted active jobs are classified, so recovery uses the
same retry/retention policy that was active before the crash. Resetting every
field to its default removes the control-state row when no other persisted
queue control needs it; `obliterate` removes it unconditionally.

| Field               | Default            | Meaning                                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `autoRetry`         | `false`            | Enable background auto-retry from DLQ                        |
| `autoRetryInterval` | `3_600_000` (1h)   | Base interval before first auto-retry; backoff multiplies it |
| `maxAutoRetries`    | `3`                | Auto-retries before `nextRetryAt` becomes `null`             |
| `maxAge`            | `604_800_000` (7d) | Age before auto-purge; `null` = never                        |
| `maxEntries`        | `10000`            | Per-queue cap; oldest evicted FIFO                           |

Numeric configuration is normalized at the domain boundary: intervals, retry counts and ages are finite non-negative integers; `maxEntries` is a finite positive integer with minimum 1. The same rule applies to embedded calls and sanitized TCP/HTTP commands.

Maintenance cadence: `config.dlqMaintenanceMs` (application config), default **60_000 ms** (`src/application/types/config.ts`). Stall thresholds that feed the `Stalled` reason come from `StallConfig` (also stored in `DlqShard`). See [Configuration & Entrypoint](./configuration.md).
