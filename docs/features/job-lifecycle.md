# Job Lifecycle (push / pull / ack / fail)

> **Category:** Jobs · **Source:** `src/application/operations/push.ts`, `src/application/operations/pushBatch.ts`, `src/application/operations/pushAdmission.ts`, `src/application/operations/pull.ts`, `src/application/operations/pullStateTransition.ts`, `src/application/operations/pullFinalization.ts`, `src/application/operations/ack.ts`, `src/application/operations/ack/`, `src/application/operations/ackHelpers.ts`, `src/application/operations/jobStateTransitions.ts`, `src/application/dependencyCompletions.ts`, `src/domain/types/jobs/model.ts`, `src/domain/job/`, `src/domain/queue/waiterManager.ts`

## Purpose

This module implements the four primitive operations that move a job through its life: **push** (enqueue), **pull** (dequeue into processing), **ack** (complete), and **fail** (retry / DLQ) for the memory/SQLite engine. It is the lowest pure-logic layer beneath the TCP/HTTP servers and embedded SDK. The optional PostgreSQL server manager exposes the same transport contract through separate async, database-authoritative transaction modules; it does not insert `await` into these synchronous shard critical sections. See [PostgreSQL 15–18 Multi-Broker Persistence](./postgres-multibroker.md).

## Responsibilities & Scope

Owns:

- The state machine for a single job: `waiting`/`prioritized`/`delayed` → `active` → `completed` | `failed` (retry back to queue or `waiting-children`/DLQ). Timeline entries are appended at each transition (`Job.timeline`, capped at `MAX_TIMELINE_ENTRIES`).
- customId idempotency and uniqueKey deduplication at push time (`handleCustomId`, `handleDeduplication`).
- Routing a pushed job to either the shard's priority queue or `waitingDeps` (dependency gate).
- Retry decision (`canRetry`), backoff computation (`calculateBackoff`), and the terminal failure → DLQ handoff.
- `removeOnComplete` / `removeOnFail` cleanup and the `depCompletions` bookkeeping that keeps dependents unblockable after the parent job is dropped.
- Manual BullMQ-style transitions: `moveActiveToWait`, `changeWaitingDelay`, `moveToWaitingChildren`.
- Long-poll worker waiting (`WaiterManager`).

Does NOT own:

- The priority-queue / heap data structures themselves — see [Data Structures](./data-structures.md).
- Shard ownership, locking primitives, and `releaseJobResources` mechanics — see [Core Queue Engine](./core-queue-engine.md) and [Concurrency & Locking](./concurrency-and-locking.md).
- Lock token creation/verification, stall sweeps, and timeout deadline scheduling — see [Worker Registry & Management](./workers-management.md) and [Background Tasks](./background-tasks.md). The `QueueManager` wraps these operations with lock verification and stall-retry recovery; the raw functions here are lock-agnostic.
- DLQ storage and retry policy — see [Dead Letter Queue](./dead-letter-queue.md).
- Dependency-graph processing after completion — see [FlowProducer & Job Dependencies](./flow-producer.md).
- Persistence batching / WAL — see [Persistence](./persistence.md).

## Dependencies

Internal:

- `src/domain/types/job.ts` is the stable facade: model types live in `src/domain/types/jobs/model.ts`, while creation, ids, locks, payload normalization, state predicates/backoff, and constants are split under `src/domain/job/`.
- `src/domain/queue/shard.ts` — per-shard `getQueue`, `incrementQueued`/`decrementQueued`, `tryAcquireConcurrency`/`tryAcquireRateLimit`, `releaseJobResources`, `addToDlq`, `waitingDeps`/`waitingChildren`, `notify`/`notifyBatch`/`waitForJob` (delegated to `WaiterManager`). See [Core Queue Engine](./core-queue-engine.md).
- `src/domain/queue/waiterManager.ts` — long-poll notification fan-out.
- `src/shared/lock.ts` — `withWriteLock`, `RWLock`. See [Concurrency & Locking](./concurrency-and-locking.md).
- `src/shared/hash.ts` — `shardIndex`, `processingShardIndex`.
- `src/shared/lru.ts` — `SetLike` / `MapLike` (bounded `completedJobs`, `jobResults`, `customIdMap`).
- `src/application/dependencyCompletions.ts` — two-tier removed-completion
  tracker plus pin, unpin, and recovery reconciliation helpers.
- `src/infrastructure/persistence/sqlite.ts` — `insertJob`, `insertJobsBatch`, `markActive`, `markActiveBatch`, `markCompleted`, `markCompletedBatch`, `updateForRetry`, `storeResult`, `saveDlqEntry`, `deleteJob`. See [Persistence](./persistence.md).
- `src/application/latencyTracker.ts`, `src/application/throughputTracker.ts` — observability counters.

External / runtime: Bun APIs — `Bun.nanoseconds()` (latency), `Bun.randomUUIDv7()` (`generateJobId`, `generateLockToken`), `setTimeout` (waiter timeout). SQLite via the storage layer.

Exported context interfaces: `PushContext` (`pushContext.ts`, re-exported by `push.ts`), `PullContext`
(`pullStateTransition.ts`, re-exported by `pull.ts`), `AckContext` (`src/application/types/ack.ts:12-49`, re-exported by the `ack.ts` facade),
plus the batch helpers `ExtractedJob`/`BatchContext`/`FinalizeContext` and
`groupByProcShard`/`extractJobs`/`groupByQueueShard`/`releaseResources`/
`finalizeBatchAck` in `ackHelpers.ts`.

Job-type helpers re-exported from the `src/domain/types/job.ts` facade: `createJob`, `generateJobId`, `jobId`, `calculateBackoff`, `canRetry`, `isReady`, `isDelayed`, `isExpired`, `isTimedOut`, `normalizeStacktrace`, `createJobLock`, `renewLock`, `isLockExpired`, and the `JobState` const enum.

TCP commands handled (routed in `src/infrastructure/server/handler-routes/jobs.ts:52-76`): **`PUSH`**, **`PUSHB`**, **`PULL`**, **`PULLB`**, **`ACK`**, **`ACKB`**, **`FAIL`**. The batch commands (`PUSHB`/`PULLB`/`ACKB`) map to `pushJobBatch`/`pullJobBatch`/`ackJobBatch`(`WithResults`).

Events broadcast (`EventType`): `pushed`, `pulled`, `completed`, `failed`, `Retried`, `Duplicated`, plus `waiting` (from `moveActiveToWait`). Dashboard-only events: `job:waiting-children`, `job:expired`, `job:deduplicated`, `batch:pushed`, `batch:pulled`, `dlq:added`, `flow:failed`, `ratelimit:rejected`, `concurrency:rejected`.

## Data Models

See [data-model](../data-model.md) for full definitions. The central shape is `Job` (`src/domain/types/jobs/model.ts:41-90`). Most relevant fields for the lifecycle:

- Scheduling: `runAt` (createdAt + delay; also the next-retry timestamp), `startedAt`, `completedAt`.
- Retry: `attempts`, `maxAttempts` (default `3`), `backoff` (default `1000` ms), `backoffConfig` (`{ type: 'fixed' | 'exponential'; delay; maxDelay? }`).
- Lifetime: `ttl`, `timeout`, `removeOnComplete`, `removeOnFail`.
- Dedup / identity: `uniqueKey`, `customId`.
- Dependencies / flow: `dependsOn`, `parentId`, `failParentOnFailure`, `removeDependencyOnFailure`, `ignoreDependencyOnFailure`, `continueParentOnFailure`.
- Failure: `stacktrace` (capped at `stackTraceLimit`, default `10`).
- `timeline: JobTimelineEntry[]` — capped at `MAX_TIMELINE_ENTRIES = 20` and persisted as a MessagePack BLOB on lifecycle transitions, so it survives SQLite recovery.

`JobInput` (`src/domain/types/jobs/model.ts:92-137`) is the wire/SDK input; `createJob` (`src/domain/job/create.ts:93-134`) fills defaults from `JOB_DEFAULTS` (`src/domain/job/constants.ts:5-13`). Note `removeOnComplete`/`removeOnFail` are coerced via `toBoolean` because the wire boundary is not runtime-type-safe (#90, `src/domain/job/create.ts:50-62`). `parseBackoff` (`src/domain/job/create.ts:5-31`) turns the object form of `backoff` into `backoffConfig` and keeps `maxDelay` only when it is a finite number in `0..MAX_BACKOFF_DELAY` (24 h); anything else is dropped so the default cap applies, because embedded `Queue.add`/`addBulk` and cron admission do not run the server validator (atomic flows do, through `validateAtomicFlowBatch`, in both modes). A `null` backoff is treated as absent.

`JobState` enum values: `waiting`, `prioritized`, `delayed`, `active`, `completed`, `failed` (`src/domain/types/jobs/model.ts:4-11`). The additional logical states `waiting-children` (dependency gate) and `paused` (queue-level) are represented via shard membership (`waitingDeps`/`waitingChildren`) and `QueueState.paused`, not the enum.

## Business Logic / Control Flow

### PUSH (`pushJob`, `src/application/operations/push.ts`)

Before single or batch admission begins, the manager reference-counts the
target queue as pending and registers its name. The count is installed before
registration callbacks and remains nonzero across asynchronous lock waits;
`finally` releases it on every success or error path. This transient ownership
prevents the periodic empty-queue sweep from unregistering a queue between its
name becoming visible and its first job being published. If `obliterate`
linearizes while the count is nonzero, it records a queue tombstone. The final
release keeps a post-obliterate admission that really published state, or
unregisters the name immediately when obliteration removed the complete
admission.

1. Compute `idx = shardIndex(queue)` and acquire every target, custom-ID owner,
   and parent shard write lock required by the request in ascending order.
2. **Inspect custom-ID idempotency** (`handleCustomId`, `customId.ts`). A live
   generation is an idempotent skip. Reusing a completed, DLQ, or
   payload-free dependency-completion generation produces a retirement plan;
   it does not delete the old generation yet. When a completed generation has
   left the bounded hot cache, the lookup consults SQLite so its row and stale
   result are still retired atomically.
3. Create the candidate job, then inspect unique-key deduplication
   (`pushDeduplication.ts`). Default/extend suppression returns the existing id.
   Replace records the exact pending or active owner without changing heap,
   index, counter, or key ownership.
4. Prepare the candidate's initial state and any removed-completion pins without
   publishing them (`pushInsert.ts`). A normal candidate is
   `waiting`/`prioritized`/`delayed`, while an unresolved dependency candidate
   is `waiting-children`. A `parentId` also prepares the child/parent topology.
5. **Commit persistence or buffer ownership before visibility.** Every
   storage-backed candidate enters either the immediate durable transaction or
   the `WriteBuffer` before RAM publication. Terminal-ID retirement, completion
   pin, dedup replacement, active-key transfer, and parent links use the
   matching SQLite admission transaction. Terminal cleanup (`jobs`, result, DLQ,
   dependency-completion and flow-failure rows), completion pins, the candidate
   insert, and parent updates commit together where applicable. If SQLite
   rejects the transaction, including `SQLITE_FULL`, the old generation and all
   RAM structures remain unchanged and the candidate is neither queryable nor
   executable.
6. Publish the committed plan to RAM: retire the old custom-ID generation and
   its result/log ownership, transfer dedup ownership, install dependency
   pins/edges, insert into the heap or wait set, update `jobIndex` and counters,
   then notify the queue. This
   publication contains no expected throwing persistence operation. The
   dashboard `job:waiting-children` callback runs only after the complete
   single, accepted batch prefix, or flow graph is persisted and published; a
   reentrant `obliterate` therefore cannot be followed by a buffered or RAM-only
   tail. Dashboard errors remain guarded from the client result.
7. Plain non-durable inserts keep the throughput path by entering the normal
   10 ms `WriteBuffer` before publication; durable inserts bypass that buffer.
   Only accepted jobs increment push telemetry and emit `pushed`.

`pushJobBatch` lives in `src/application/operations/pushBatch.ts` and preserves
ordered accepted-prefix semantics. Each item completes the same admission
sequence before the next item begins. If item N is rejected, items before N
remain accepted and recoverable according to their durability mode; item N and
all later items remain absent. A rejection of the first durable item therefore
leaves no phantom batch in either Embedded or TCP mode.

Pending batch persistence keeps the append-only array fast path for ordinary
jobs. The first in-batch deduplication replacement lazily builds a job-ID index;
later replacements tombstone and remove their superseded pending rows from that
index in O(1), while the surviving rows retain accepted order. Building the
index once plus the final tombstone filter makes this bookkeeping O(n) instead
of repeatedly scanning and splicing the pending array. The persisted and
notified counts exclude tombstones. `test/push-batch-dedup-index.test.ts` covers
reverse-order replacements and verifies the surviving generations after an
SQLite restart.

### PULL (`pullJob`, `pull.ts`)

1. `deadline = timeoutMs > 0 ? now + timeoutMs : 0`. Loop:
2. `tryPullFromShard` under `shardLocks[idx]` returns `null` if the queue is
   paused, then delegates selection to `tryDequeueNextJob`
   (`pullStateTransition.ts`).
3. `tryDequeueNextJob` inspects jobs in priority order. Expired entries are
   discarded exactly once from persistence, the heap, counters, and `jobIndex`.
   Delayed jobs and jobs whose FIFO group is active are moved into a dequeue
   scratch object while the scan looks for eligible work. Capacity is consumed
   only after an eligible job is found. The queue pop, processing insert, and
   `jobIndex` flip remain in the same synchronous shard critical section.
4. A single pull creates one scratch and restores its parked jobs in `finally`.
   A batch shares one scratch across all requested jobs and restores it once
   after the entire batch. Readiness cannot change inside that synchronous
   critical section: `now` is fixed and the active-group set only grows.
   Consequently the batch cost is `O((k + b) log n)`, rather than repeatedly
   paying `O(k log n)` for each of the `b` delivered jobs. `nextRunAt` retains
   the minimum deadline across every parked delayed job so long-poll wake-up
   semantics remain unchanged.
5. `finalizeProcessing` in `pullFinalization.ts` uses
   `storage.markActive(...)` for a single handoff (non-fatal on error —
   in-memory is source of truth), bumps counters, and broadcasts `pulled`. It
   returns `false` when a management operation claimed the job before handoff.
6. If no job and deadline not reached, `await shard.waitForJob(queue, remaining)`
   and loop; otherwise return `null`.

`pullJobBatch` pulls up to `count` jobs in one shard lock, acquiring exactly one
rate-limit and concurrency slot per selected job. A blocked or delayed entry
consumes neither. If a limiter stops a partially filled batch, every parked job
is still restored by the outer `finally`; `finalizeProcessingBatch` returns only
the jobs actually delivered. Those survivors are packed before the SQLite
critical section and persisted by one `markActiveBatch` transaction. On a batch
failure SQLite rolls back every row, then the application retries each scalar
`markActive`; scalar errors remain non-fatal, preserving the historical
in-memory-authoritative delivery contract.

**Safety net:** if `finalizeProcessing` throws, `requeueJob`
(`pullStateTransition.ts`) restores the job with the same observer-atomicity
rule in reverse. It skips entirely if a management operation already claimed
the job. Lock order shard → processing matches the documented hierarchy.

### ACK (`ackJob`, `src/application/operations/ack/completion.ts:11-93`)

1. Under `processingLocks[procIdx]`, remove the job from `processingShards`; if absent, **throw** `Job not found or not in processing state` (the `QueueManager` catches this to recover stall-retried jobs — see Edge Cases).
2. Under `shardLocks[idx]`, `releaseJobResources(queue, uniqueKey, groupId, job.id)` frees the concurrency slot/group and releases the unique key only if this job generation still owns it.
3. Release `customId` from `customIdMap` so it can be reused.
4. If `!removeOnComplete`: set `completedAt`, append `completed` timeline, add
   to `completedJobs` + `completedJobsData`, store a defined result together
   with its queue in the paired bounded `jobResultQueues` ownership index, set
   `jobIndex` to completed, and persist the completed row. If
   `removeOnComplete`: `commitRemovedCompletion` atomically deletes the
   jobs/result rows and inserts a payload-free `dependency_completions` record.
   It is marked `pinned` when a reverse waiter exists; otherwise it enters the
   bounded recent FIFO. Only after commit does the matching in-memory marker
   become visible. The job remains absent from Job/state/result/completed
   queries.
5. Bump counters, broadcast `completed`, call `onJobCompleted` (dependency processing), and re-schedule repeatable jobs via `onRepeat` if under `repeat.limit`.

### FAIL (`failJob`, `src/application/operations/ack/failure.ts:63-175`)

1. Extract from `processingShards` (throw if absent, as above).
2. `attempts++`; if a `stack` is supplied, store `normalizeStacktrace(stack, stackTraceLimit)` BEFORE branching so both a retry and a DLQ entry carry it (#74, `ack/failure.ts:79-84`). Append `failed` timeline entry.
3. Under `shardLocks[idx]`, `releaseJobResources`, then branch:
   - **Retry** (`!unrecoverable && canRetry(job)`, i.e. `attempts < maxAttempts`): `runAt = now + calculateBackoff(job)`, push back to queue, `incrementQueued(..., isDelayed=true, ...)`, `storage.updateForRetry`, set `wasRetried`. Appends a `waiting` timeline entry for the next attempt.
   - **removeOnFail**: delete from index + disk, bump `totalFailed`, release customId.
   - **Terminal → DLQ** (`moveFailedJobToDlq`, `ack/failure.ts:17-43`): `addToDlq(job, MaxAttemptsExceeded, error)`, set `jobIndex` to `dlq`, atomically commit the DLQ row plus job-row removal (and any flow-failure outbox record), bump `totalFailed`, emit `dlq:added` (+ `flow:failed` if `parentId`).

`Discard` reaches the same terminal state from waiting or active work. Its
DLQ insert and live-row deletion remain synchronous while the destination shard
lock is held, so a concurrent `RemoveDlqJob` cannot delete the visible entry
before a late SQLite insert. Selective permanent removal then transitions
`failed` to absent without retrying and releases terminal indexes, custom-ID,
dependency-result, result/log, and parent flow-failure ownership. 4. Broadcast `failed`; if retried, also broadcast `Retried` (prev `failed`). 5. Flow propagation when NOT retried: `failParentOnFailure` → `onChildTerminalFailure`; `removeDependencyOnFailure`/`ignoreDependencyOnFailure`/`continueParentOnFailure` → `onChildDependencyOption`.

`calculateBackoff` (`src/domain/job/state.ts:37-54`): fixed = `delay * (0.8 + rand*0.4)` (±20% jitter); exponential / default = `base * 2^attempts * (0.5 + rand)` (±50% jitter), capped at `backoffConfig.maxDelay ?? DEFAULT_MAX_BACKOFF` (1 h). The same cap governs stall retries. The processor `DelayedError` re-delay (`calculateDelayedErrorDelay`, same file) uses the base delay without growth or jitter (a non-positive or `NaN` base falls back to `1000`), capped at a positive finite `maxDelay`, else `DEFAULT_MAX_BACKOFF`: a `maxDelay` of `0` does not apply there, so a job that keeps throwing `DelayedError` never re-runs without a wait. `maxDelay` is carried into repeat successors (`buildRepeatSuccessor` copies `backoffConfig`) and cron-spawned jobs (`CronJobOptions.backoff`).

### Batch ack (`ackHelpers.ts`)

`ackJobBatch`/`ackJobBatchWithResults` short-circuit to parallel per-job
`ackJob` for ≤4 ids. Larger batches: `groupByProcShard` → `extractJobs` (one
lock per processing shard, parallel) → `groupByQueueShard` →
`releaseResources` (one lock per queue shard) → `finalizeBatchAck`.
Both paths return one extraction boolean per input position. `QueueManagerAck`
classifies every `false` only after the processing lock: an exact retired
timeout/cron generation becomes `ignored`, while an arbitrary missing job or
wrong token remains an error. Positional evidence prevents duplicate job IDs
from hiding which generation was retired.
`removeOnComplete` entries use the same delete-plus-proof transaction in both
optimized variants, including result-bearing ACKB. For retained jobs,
`jobResults.set` and its queue owner happen before `completedJobs.add`, so a
live dependent never observes completion before its in-memory result. When every extracted job is
retained and no defined result must be stored, `finalizeBatchAck` precomputes
the capped completion timelines and commits all rows through one
`markCompletedBatch` transaction. A failed batch rolls back before the original
scalar loop runs. Batches containing a defined result or any removal keep the
existing per-job ordering and transaction boundaries.

### Manual transitions (`jobStateTransitions.ts`)

`moveActiveToWait` (`:16`): processing → queue (`runAt = now`,
`startedAt = null`, release resources, push, persist via `updateRunAt`, broadcast
`waiting` prev `active`). Persisting the transition prevents restart recovery
from misclassifying the manually requeued job as an interrupted active attempt.
`changeWaitingDelay` (`:59`) updates `runAt` in place.
`moveToWaitingChildren` (`:84`) parks processing work in
`shard.waitingChildren`. Every management claim of active work also releases
the lease and client ownership through `releaseClaimedJobOwnership`.

## Concurrency & Locking

Locks are per-shard `RWLock`s acquired via `withWriteLock` and are **sequential, not nested** within each operation, which avoids deadlock despite differing acquisition orders:

- `pushJob`: `shardLocks[idx]` only (persistence + broadcast happen after release).
- `pullJob`: `shardLocks[idx]` owns the synchronous queue → processing
  transition; persistence and delivery bookkeeping run after release.
- `ackJob` / `failJob`: `processingLocks[procIdx]` (extract) released, then `shardLocks[idx]` (release resources / requeue / DLQ).

Batch ack acquires each processing-shard lock and each queue-shard lock at most once, in parallel across distinct shards (`O(shards)` not `O(n)` — `src/application/operations/ack/batch.ts:23-74`).

Lock-token verification and stall-retry recovery live in
`queue-manager/ack.ts`; the shared `assertLeaseToken` generation check lives in
`queue-manager/delivery.ts`. Whenever a lease record exists, ACK, FAIL, both
ACKB forms, and active manual moves require its exact token in embedded and TCP
mode. Batch ownership is preflighted before the first extraction. An expired
but still-current token is accepted (#101), while a token from an older
processing generation is rejected. With no lease, an administrative active
transition remains valid. `WaiterManager` partitions waiters by queue, tracks
the active count in O(1), and consumes entries through a head cursor.
Notifications clear the waiter's timer immediately; surplus notifications
coalesce into one edge-triggered `pending` bit instead of accumulating
notification debt. The array is compacted only after the consumed prefix
reaches 1,024 entries and at least half the array. ACK/fail and every path that
releases concurrency/group ownership notify the released job's queue, so an
unrelated queue cannot steal the wake-up.

Long-poll waiters also accept an optional `AbortSignal`. TCP creates one signal
per connection and aborts it before disconnect-time lease release. Aborting
removes the waiter and timer without creating a pending notification. Pull
checks the signal before attempting a dequeue and immediately after acquiring
the shard lock, before rate/concurrency acquisition. Thus cancellation while
queued on the lock consumes no limiter token. If cancellation lands at the
handoff boundary, the final guard requeues the job and releases
group/concurrency ownership before persistence, pulled counters, events, or
lock-token creation. The same contract applies to single, batch, owner-lock,
detached CLI, and durable recovery paths.

## Edge Cases & Failure Modes

- **Idempotent push**: a live `customId` returns the existing job (no insert). A recycled terminal `customId` evicts the stale completed row or DLQ entry first, including persisted terminal state, counters, result, logs, and their bounded owner indexes, so state queries and auxiliary reads expose only the new generation; timeout markers are cleared too (#33/#75).
- **Dedup of active jobs**: default strategy treats an active job (in `jobIndex`, not in queue) as a duplicate and returns its id without inserting (`src/application/operations/pushDeduplication.ts:96-110`); the returned placeholder carries the correct existing id (`src/application/operations/push.ts:76-85`).
- **Pull loss prevention**: `requeueJob` restores any job that fails to move to processing.
- **Expired (TTL) jobs** are silently dropped during pull (`isExpired`) and never delivered. Their SQLite row (or pending buffered INSERT) is deleted before the heap/counter/index removal, preventing restart resurrection while keeping the shard critical section synchronous.
- **markActive / persistence errors** during pull are swallowed — an atomic batch failure retries through scalar `markActive`, and individual failures remain non-fatal because in-memory `processingShards` is the source of truth; SQLite recovery reconciles on restart.
- **Late processor outcomes**: the timeout transition records the exact claimed
  processing generation (`jobId`, `startedAt`, and lease token when present)
  while holding the processing lock. ACK and FAIL classify again after their
  own claim point, closing the validation-to-claim race. An exact retired
  timeout or lock-expired `cron:` lease returns
  `{ applied: false, reason: 'already-finalized' }`; ACKB additionally returns
  ordered `ignoredIds` and `ignoredIndices`. Workers suppress local terminal
  events for those outcomes. Missing IDs, missing/wrong tokens, and duplicate
  outcomes against ordinary completed jobs still throw and cannot release a
  newer lease.
- **Obliterate during terminal extraction:** once ACK/ACKB/FAIL removes a job
  from the processing map, the queue-bearing `jobIndex` remains authoritative.
  The terminal path revalidates it after any shard-lock wait and immediately
  before synchronous publication. If queue obliteration removed that owner in
  the gap, the transition returns ignored/not-found and cannot resurrect the
  old generation.
- **Retry vs. terminal**: `canRetry` uses `attempts < maxAttempts` after `attempts++`; `unrecoverable=true` (from `failJob`) forces the terminal path regardless of attempts.
- **Stack trace persistence** (#74): the last failure's stack is normalized and capped at `stackTraceLimit` before branching; an absent stack (old clients) leaves any prior stack intact; `stackTraceLimit: 0` yields `null`.
- **Memory bounds**: `timeline` is capped at 20 entries (older transitions are
  not recorded once full). `completedJobs`, `jobResults`, `jobLogs`, and
  `customIdMap` are bounded LRU/FIFO collections; result/log queue-owner maps
  follow the same evictions (see [Core Queue Engine](./core-queue-engine.md) /
  [Background Tasks](./background-tasks.md)).
- **removeOnComplete + dependencies**: the full job is dropped but its bare ID
  enters the two-tier `depCompletions` tracker. Proofs referenced by
  `waitingDeps` stay pinned even when a batch is larger than
  `maxCompletedJobs`; after the last reverse edge is durably resolved or
  removed, the proof becomes recent and ordinary FIFO pruning applies. Recent
  proof eviction uses a stale-aware explicit order, so sustained completion
  churn remains amortized O(1) after the retention cap is reached.
- **PostgreSQL completion generations:** a `removeOnComplete` proof is tied to
  one custom-ID generation. Reuse retires the old proof only when it has no live
  consumer. Unreferenced tombstones are retained newest-first up to
  `maxCompletedJobs`; referenced proofs remain pinned outside that cap. The
  result snapshot is bounded independently by `maxJobResults`, while durable
  child-value reads still resolve from PostgreSQL after local eviction.
- **Repeatable jobs**: re-scheduled via `onRepeat` only while `repeat.limit` is undefined or `repeat.count < limit`.

## Configuration

These operations read no environment variables directly; behavior is driven by per-job `JobInput` options and constants:

| Option / constant                            | Default              | Effect                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `JobInput.maxAttempts`                       | `3` (`JOB_DEFAULTS`) | Retry ceiling (`canRetry`).                                     |
| `JobInput.backoff`                           | `1000` ms            | Base retry delay; object form selects `fixed`/`exponential`.    |
| `JobInput.backoff.maxDelay`                  | `3_600_000` ms       | Per-job cap on one retry delay; accepts `0..86_400_000` ms.     |
| `JobInput.priority`                          | `0`                  | Higher = dequeued sooner; >0 sets `prioritized` timeline state. |
| `JobInput.delay`                             | `0`                  | Adds to `runAt`; >0 → `delayed`.                                |
| `JobInput.ttl`                               | `null`               | Expiry; expired jobs skipped on pull.                           |
| `JobInput.timeout`                           | `null`               | Processing timeout enforced by the next-deadline scheduler.     |
| `JobInput.removeOnComplete` / `removeOnFail` | `false`              | Drop job on success / failure.                                  |
| `JobInput.durable`                           | `false`              | SQLite: bypass the ~10 ms buffer; PostgreSQL is transactional.  |
| `JobInput.stackTraceLimit`                   | `10`                 | Max stored stack lines.                                         |
| `DEFAULT_MAX_BACKOFF`                        | `3_600_000` ms       | Backoff cap when `backoff.maxDelay` is absent.                  |
| `MAX_BACKOFF_DELAY`                          | `86_400_000` ms      | Upper bound for `backoff`, `backoff.delay`, `backoff.maxDelay`. |
| `MAX_TIMELINE_ENTRIES`                       | `20`                 | Timeline cap.                                                   |
| `pullJob` `timeoutMs`                        | `0` (no wait)        | Long-poll deadline; Worker `pollTimeout` max 30 000 ms.         |
| `DEFAULT_LOCK_TTL`                           | `30_000` ms          | Lock duration (used by `pullWithLock`, not the raw pull).       |
