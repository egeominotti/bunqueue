# Test Isolation and Reproducibility

This document is the authoritative engineering reference for running bunqueue's
test suites without reusing host processes, ports, databases, or environment
state. Performance benchmarks use a different isolation model; see
[Benchmarks are native](#benchmarks-are-native).

## Validation layers

Development uses complementary layers so feedback remains fast without
weakening the release gate:

1. Run the narrowest relevant test in an isolated OrbStack development Machine
   on the Mac's native architecture while iterating. A macOS-host run is
   diagnostic only.
2. For the final candidate, run the product suites directly in a fresh Ubuntu
   24.04 Machine and, for a release, repeat them in a fresh Debian 13 Machine.
   Both use the Mac's native architecture; GitHub Actions supplies native
   `amd64` coverage when development occurs on Apple Silicon.
3. Before a commit, run `bun run test:sandbox`. It builds the current worktree
   into one test image and runs the required unit, TCP, and embedded suites in
   three independent disposable containers in parallel.
4. When an external SDK changes, also run `bun run test:sandbox:sdk`. It builds
   dedicated TypeScript, Python, PHP, Go, Rust, and Elixir images, then runs
   each SDK's native tests and shared protocol conformance checks in parallel.

The sandbox executes these exact commands:

```bash
bun test --parallel=4
bun scripts/tcp/run-all-tests.ts
bun scripts/embedded/run-all-tests.ts
```

The unit suite uses Bun 1.4's process-level file parallelism with four workers.
`--parallel` implies per-file isolation, while tests inside each file remain
serial unless they opt into `test.concurrent`. The explicit worker count keeps
local, sandbox, and CI behavior consistent instead of scaling unexpectedly with
the host's CPU count.

`test/cli-invariants-e2e.test.ts` runs four campaigns that each start multiple
real CLI processes sequentially. Their 20-second aggregate test deadline is
separate from the unchanged 5-second watchdog around every child process. This
lets a contended parallel runner finish the complete command matrix without
allowing one hung command to consume the campaign budget or escape cleanup.

`test/bug-embedded-heartbeat-token.test.ts` uses `setSystemTime()` to advance
the wall clock across the original lease expiry. It observes `renewalCount`,
`lastRenewalAt`, and `expiresAt` before verifying the lease and acknowledging
the job. This preserves the single and batch token-forwarding regression while
removing real sleeps and their former 50-millisecond scheduling margin.

`test/repro-chaos-soak.test.ts` deliberately runs beside that parallel load.
Its churn oracle records each worker termination attempt with `performance.now()` and
derives the realistic cycle from the configured kill interval plus the socket
release delay. Configuration arithmetic is normalized to safe integer
microseconds, and configurations whose derived cycle or gap bounds are unsafe
are rejected. A valid campaign must execute at least half of the possible
strictly pre-deadline cycles, use finite strictly increasing timestamps inside
the load window, and leave no gap longer than four cycles, including the leading
and trailing gaps. This proves that churn spans the campaign without treating an
ideal timer count as an event-loop guarantee on a contended CI runner. Job
conservation, terminal state, collection cleanup, latency, and memory remain
independent hard assertions. WAL size remains diagnostic telemetry in the soak
report.

The unit command includes `test/package-consumer-smoke.test.ts`. That test runs
the library build, creates the exact npm tarball without network access, unpacks
it into an isolated consumer's `node_modules`, and imports every documented Bun
entrypoint. This guards package `exports`, included files, generated
declarations, and runtime module resolution rather than relying on source-tree
imports.

Two details of that test are load-bearing, and both were found by the Linux
sandbox after the macOS host had passed:

- **Unpack the package, never symlink it.** Bun resolves a dependency by walking
  up from the importing file's realpath, so a symlinked package searches next to
  its extraction directory and never sees the consumer's `node_modules`. Only
  the real installed layout exercises the published resolution paths.
- **Provide exactly the manifest's declared dependencies.** The consumer links
  `msgpackr` from the repository's `node_modules`, which keeps the
  test offline while asserting the stronger property: the declared dependency
  set is sufficient to import every entrypoint. A runtime import that the
  manifest forgets to declare fails here instead of in a user's project.

It imports all five runtime entrypoints — `bunqueue`, `bunqueue/client`,
`bunqueue/queue`, `bunqueue/workflow` and `bunqueue/mcp`. `./mcp` is the only
one with an optional peer, so it is asserted separately: without
`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` a consumer must get the actionable install message
and a non-zero exit, never a module-resolution stack trace.

`test/repro-embedded-manager-leak-order.test.ts` locks the order-dependent
failure that shipped in 2.8.56. Bun discovers test files in readdir order rather
than sorted order, so a suite that leaves an embedded manager alive can affect
whichever suite happens to run next — a different one on macOS than on Linux.
An explicit conflicting `dataPath` now fails at construction instead of writing
to the previous suite's database. Embedded suites that select a persistent path
must claim the singleton with `beforeAll(shutdownManager)` before constructing
clients. Their teardown must close every Queue, Worker, or Engine before calling
`shutdownManager()` and removing temporary databases; `beforeEach` can provide
stronger per-test isolation when a suite does not intentionally reuse a manager.
`test/repro-ci-embedded-suite-isolation.test.ts` locks those entry and exit
boundaries for the persistent suites involved in the v2.8.60 Linux CI failure.
`test/repro-ci-workflow-manager-order.test.ts` runs the in-memory Workflow loop
suite before a SQLite-backed timeout regression in a child process, locking the
same Linux CI order that failed the v2.8.58 release gate.

`test/repro-bunqueue-sync-throw-cancellation.test.ts` drives a synchronous
Simple Mode processor failure through real retries and verifies that terminal
state releases both the public signal and every internal cancellation
generation. This distinguishes synchronous throws from ordinary rejected
Promises without bypassing the Worker path. A second case makes the configured
circuit-breaker hook throw and verifies that `finally` cleanup still owns the
same generation. The remaining cases prove that synchronous failures follow
the configured in-process retry policy and that closing during an armed
backoff prevents every later processor invocation. The shutdown regression
also enables a circuit breaker and proves that the abort cannot call `onOpen`
or re-arm the breaker's reset timer after destruction. A complementary
half-open case cancels a processor that deliberately ignores the signal and
verifies that its successful outcome still closes the circuit, preserving the
public cooperative-cancellation behavior.

`test/issue-93-bun-only.test.ts` follows the same principle. Its end-to-end
`node` spawn used to skip whenever `dist/bun-only.js` was missing, which made its
coverage depend on whether some other file had run `build:lib` first; it now
builds the artifact itself. The remaining gate is a real Node on `PATH`, which is
a stable property of the environment rather than of test ordering. That check is
deliberately stricter than "is `node` callable": the Bun image ships
`/usr/local/bun-node-fallback-bin/node`, a shim that runs Bun, and under it the
import resolves the `bun` condition and exits 0 — passing while asserting the
opposite of the contract.

Be explicit about where that end-to-end case actually executes, so nobody later
mistakes it for coverage it does not provide:

| Environment                                 | `node` on `PATH`                | e2e case |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------- |
| GitHub Actions `ubuntu-latest`              | real Node from the runner image | runs     |
| macOS host with Node installed              | real Node                       | runs     |
| `bun run test:sandbox` (`oven/bun`)         | Bun fallback shim               | skipped  |
| Ubuntu 24.04 / Debian 13 Machine (Bun only) | absent                          | skipped  |

CI is therefore the environment that enforces the contract; the container and
Machine gates only assert the three Node-independent contract checks. The probe
must survive the absent case as well as the shim case: `Bun.spawnSync` throws on
a missing binary instead of returning a non-zero exit code, and an uncaught throw
in a `describe` body aborts the entire file — reporting `0 pass / 1 error` and
silently dropping the Node-independent assertions with it. It is wrapped in
`try`/`catch` for that reason.

### OrbStack Machine isolation

The canonical local Machine is Ubuntu 24.04 on the Mac's native architecture,
with 4 CPUs, a requested 16 GiB of memory, and at least 32 GiB of disk. The
release compatibility Machine uses Debian 13 on the same architecture. On
Apple Silicon both are `arm64`; GitHub Actions `ubuntu-latest` supplies the
independent native `amd64` gate. Both Machines are disposable and must be
created for one final candidate only:

```bash
machine_run_id="$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)"
case "$(uname -m)" in
  arm64) machine_arch=arm64 ;;
  x86_64) machine_arch=amd64 ;;
  *) echo "Unsupported host architecture" >&2; exit 1 ;;
esac
orb create --isolated --isolate-network --arch "${machine_arch}" \
  --cpus 4 --memory 16G --disk 32G ubuntu:24.04 \
  "bunqueue-ci-${machine_run_id}"
orb create --isolated --isolate-network --arch "${machine_arch}" \
  --cpus 4 --memory 16G --disk 32G debian:13 \
  "bunqueue-debian-${machine_run_id}"
```

Do not count a translated `amd64` Machine on Apple Silicon as release evidence.
It is a useful diagnostic target, but Rosetta can change process-heavy Bun
behavior; repeat the complete result on `arm64`. Record both requested resources
and effective cgroup CPU/memory limits because OrbStack can clamp a Machine to
its global resource ceiling.

Do not add `--mount` or `--forward-ssh-agent`. A Machine must never receive the
macOS home directory, repository mount, Docker socket, `.git`, SSH agent,
credentials, registry tokens, `.env` files, ignored files, `node_modules`,
artifacts, SQLite databases, or generated test output. A tracked
placeholder-only template such as `.env.example` is allowed only after its
contents have been reviewed. Build an explicit
sanitized snapshot containing every tracked and intended untracked change,
then transfer that snapshot through OrbStack's built-in SSH endpoint. The
`orb push` command cannot write an isolated Machine's host-exposed read-only
filesystem;
install `rsync` in the Machine and use `rsync -e ssh ... MACHINE@orb:...`
instead. The SSH private key remains on macOS and is not forwarded into the
Machine. This avoids both testing stale committed code and leaking unrelated
host state.

Install the exact Bun version pinned in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and use
`bun install --frozen-lockfile --ignore-scripts`. Directly inside each Machine,
run the unit, TCP, and embedded commands above plus:

```bash
bun run typecheck
bun run check:oxc
```

The Machine gate also supplies a real bounded filesystem for SQLite admission
tests. Create it inside the disposable Machine, never on a host mount:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/bunqueue-tinyfs
sudo mount -t tmpfs -o size=16m tmpfs /mnt/bunqueue-tinyfs
sudo chown "$(id -u):$(id -g)" /mnt/bunqueue-tinyfs
BUNQUEUE_TINYFS=/mnt/bunqueue-tinyfs bun test test/repro-disk-full.test.ts
sudo umount /mnt/bunqueue-tinyfs
```

This is a required Machine check, not published benchmark evidence. The normal
unit suite always runs the deterministic storage-rejection injections in
`test/repro-durable-persistence-rejection.test.ts`; the tmpfs run adds real
`SQLITE_FULL` coverage for single and batch admission in Embedded and TCP mode,
terminal custom-ID reuse across restart, preserved completed results/DLQ rows,
and buffered storage-health recovery.

Run `git diff --check` on the macOS host before building the snapshot. The
Machine cannot run Git worktree checks because `.git` is deliberately excluded.

Each run records its distro/version, architecture, kernel, Bun version and
revision, frozen-lockfile installation result, commands, exit codes, durations,
and exact test totals. Copy the manifest and logs back under `artifacts/`, then
delete the Machine. A reused Machine, host-only run, or run against a mounted
worktree is diagnostic evidence only.

`--isolated` removes macOS filesystem and integration access;
`--isolate-network` also blocks direct access to the host and other Machines.
It does not create an independent kernel: OrbStack Machines and containers
share OrbStack's underlying Linux kernel. The Machine layer therefore catches
clean-host, architecture, distribution, and hidden-state problems, while the
container sandbox remains the authoritative offline per-suite containment
layer. Neither is a physical-machine security boundary.

Queue, Worker, Cron, and DLQ guide coverage is tracked explicitly in
[Documented Feature Verification](./features/documented-feature-verification.md).
`test/documented-feature-coverage.test.ts` requires every requested section to
retain both TCP and embedded evidence and checks that every authoritative
shared contract has symmetric wrappers. The functional runners discover those
wrappers by their `test-*.ts` names, so the matrix is exercised by the same
sandbox gate rather than by a separate optional suite.

`test/source-architecture.test.ts` additionally enforces the 300-line source
ceiling, thin QueueManager/Queue/Worker/SandboxedWorker façades, dedicated type
modules, and documentation references that point at focused implementation
modules instead of obsolete line numbers in the façades.

The Docker build includes uncommitted files from the current worktree, so the
validated source is the source being reviewed. It never bind-mounts the host
repository into a test container.

One class of failure escapes every container: the docs site can build from files
that exist on the author's disk but were never committed, so it goes red in CI
only. `bun run check:docs-data` (part of `bun run check`, and a step in the CI docs
job) asserts that everything `docs/src/content/docs/**` references is git-tracked
and that the committed `apiVersions.json` still matches its generator. See
[the generated API reference](./generated-api-reference.md#the-guard-bun-run-checkdocs-data).

The SDK gate writes complete `*.build.log` and suite logs plus the same NDJSON,
per-suite JSON, and aggregate report schema under
`artifacts/test-sandbox-sdk/<timestamp>/`. A failed image build also produces a
failure summary instead of exiting without artifacts. `Dockerfile.sdk-test`
uses one target per toolchain so SDK dependencies and language versions remain
isolated; runtime containers have no external network, credentials, home
mount, repository mount, or Docker socket. The minimal build context retains
the root `.gitignore` so Oxfmt uses the same ignore boundary as the worktree.
Cloudflare's local runtime receives
`CLOUDFLARE_CF_FETCH_ENABLED=false`, preventing its optional `Request.cf`
metadata fetch from weakening the no-network guarantee or delaying the gate.
The TypeScript target also includes Node 22, matching CI, because Wrangler's
`unstable_dev` runner is a Node process even though the SDK and broker use Bun.

The six SDK suites execute:

```bash
# TypeScript
bun run build && bun run check && bun pm pack
bun tests/integration.ts && bun tests/e2e.ts
bun run test:workers
# Python
python -m compileall -q bunqueue tests
python -m build --no-isolation --outdir /tmp/python-package
python tests/test_integration.py && python tests/run_e2e.py
# PHP / Go
composer validate --strict --no-check-publish
find src tests -name '*.php' -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 php -l
php tests/run-e2e.php
test -z "$(gofmt -l .)" && go vet ./... && go list ./...
go test -v ./...
go test -race -run 'Hardening|Regression|Worker' ./...
# Rust / Elixir
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --locked
cargo package --locked --offline --allow-dirty --no-verify
mix format --check-formatted && mix compile --warnings-as-errors
mix test --slowest 20 && mix hex.build
```

Every suite then runs its language driver through all 18 shared conformance
checks against two fresh real brokers: one uses an isolated temporary SQLite
database and one uses an isolated namespace in the gate's shared disposable
PostgreSQL 18.6 container. The broker alone receives database credentials.
Drivers retain the toolchain environment required by their language, but a
case-insensitive policy removes bunqueue, PostgreSQL/libpq, AWS/S3, storage/TLS,
and delimiter-named credential variables before startup. Collision tests prove
that non-secret names such as `TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM` remain available. This is
environment redaction for repository-owned drivers, not an untrusted-code
sandbox. The harness proves broker exit with bounded `SIGTERM`/`SIGKILL`
handling before deleting SQLite data or namespace rows; failed startups use the
same ownership order. The sandbox waits for all started suites, validates Docker
teardown exit codes, keeps failed ownership retryable, never force-removes an
unconfirmed container name, and aggregates startup and cleanup errors.

The conformance runner starts every driver command with `sdk/conformance` as
its working directory. Commands for nested language modules must select their
module explicitly: Go CI uses `go -C drivers/go run .`, while the isolated SDK
sandbox may prebuild the driver and execute `./drivers/go-driver`. Do not use
`go run ./drivers/go`; Go resolves `go.mod` from the command's working directory,
not from the package path, so that form fails before the driver can connect.
The core test image copies this workflow file so its command contract is also
covered by the unit-suite regression test.

TCP test harnesses pass `port: 0` and read the listener's assigned port so the
kernel chooses and binds it atomically. Random high-port probing is not safe
under the parallel unit gate because another listener can claim the port before
the server bind. `test/repro-ci-dynamic-port.test.ts` enforces this contract for
the TCP protocol audit that exercises slowloris protection, write backpressure,
and large-frame reassembly.

## Model-based broker verification

`bun run test:model` runs the `fast-check` asynchronous command model described
in [Model-Based Queue Verification](./features/model-based-testing.md). Each
property run owns a fresh broker subprocess, dynamic ports, queue, TCP client,
and temporary SQLite database. Commands execute only when their model
precondition is valid; after each command the test compares API state, aggregate
counts, lock ownership, SQLite rows, DLQ rows, payloads, priorities, and
persisted queue controls.

The queue model owns the same lease tokens as a real worker. `PULL` and `PULLB`
store the token returned for every active job; active acknowledgements,
heartbeats, failures, `MoveToWait`, `MoveToDelayed`, and `ChangeDelay` must send
that exact token. The same transition commands omit `token` when they act on a
delayed, failed, waiting, or prioritized job with no live lease. Deterministic
command-serialization tests protect this distinction so a model expectation
cannot accidentally bypass the engine's lease enforcement.

The default campaign uses 150 runs and at most 80 generated commands. It is part
of the full `bun test --parallel=4` unit suite, so the mandatory `test:sandbox`
unit container executes it without a separate container. For deeper native
investigation:

```bash
BUNQUEUE_MODEL_RUNS=500 \
BUNQUEUE_MODEL_COMMANDS=150 \
BUNQUEUE_MODEL_SEED=424242 \
bun run test:model
```

The workflow campaign closes every `Engine`, shuts down the process-wide
embedded `QueueManager`, and only then removes its shared temporary SQLite
directory. This ordering prevents background lock/DLQ timers from touching a
database after teardown and keeps model output free of false disk-I/O alarms.

Its compensation ledger records the reversal's `ctx.idempotencyKey` separately
from `ctx.forwardIdempotencyKey`: the first deduplicates the undo at the provider,
while the second reconciles the original forward effect. A force-close may leave
an undo complete without its SQLite checkpoint, so the oracle permits one
sequential replay in each replacement Engine generation only when both keys stay
stable. It still rejects multiple successful dispatches inside one generation;
the harness does not inject store-write failures, so that shape identifies live
recovery re-entry rather than an ambiguous checkpoint outcome.

Forward retry budgets stay cumulative across Engine generations. Bun 1.4 made
seed `-795204925`, path `10`, reproduce a retry timer from a force-closed Engine
racing its replacement and dispatching a fourth call against a budget of three.
`test/repro-model-workflow-force-close-retry.test.ts` retains that exact graph
and operator history; shutdown must stop the old executor before the timer can
invoke user code again. `test/repro-workflow-graceful-close-retry.test.ts`
separately proves that graceful close drains the retry, while forced close
cannot persist a late final failure or start its compensation after returning.

Failures report a seed, a minimized command history, and a replay path. Convert
every confirmed engine divergence into a deterministic
`test/repro-model-*.test.ts` regression before applying the fix. Model
expectation errors remain model fixes; for example `JobHeartbeatB` deliberately
returns its count in `data.count`, while `ACKB` deliberately returns only the
top-level success envelope and no count.

Each generated run uses a separate broker and an adjacent TCP/HTTP port pair.
Startup is complete only after both HTTP `/ready` and TCP `Hello` succeed. The
harness captures subprocess stderr and retries only a confirmed bind collision;
timeouts and all other startup failures retain their diagnostics and fail the
test instead of being hidden by a generic port-wait timeout.

Client command bounds in the multi-broker public-API suites are sized for a
saturated shared runner, not for a quiet laptop: four brokers, one PostgreSQL
and the test process compete for the same cores, so a 15s bound turned CPU
starvation into a false timeout. Those suites assert exactly-once semantics, so
the bound is deliberately generous and the wall time of the file grows with it.

The multi-process PostgreSQL harness (`test/support/postgres-process-cluster.ts`)
follows the same policy for the same reason: reserving a pair releases the probe
sockets before the broker binds them, so a concurrent worker can win that
window. Both harnesses classify a collision with the shared
`test/support/bind-collision.ts` predicate, which has to match two wordings
because `Bun.listen` and `Bun.serve` report a taken port differently
(`Failed to listen at <host>` versus `Is port <n> in use?`) and the server
propagates only the message. Retries are limited to a broker that actually
exited, so a readiness timeout still fails with its own diagnostics.

## SDK hardening matrix

The native suites use each public SDK against real disposable brokers. Every
language covers the same failure classes, with idiomatic mechanics:

| Layer                    | Required SDK evidence                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Contract                 | All 18 independent producer/consumer conformance checks                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Race / idempotency       | Many independent connections retry one custom id; many live connections contend for one lease; worker concurrency stays bounded                                                                                                         |
| Property / fuzz          | Native generators shrink flow plans while checking graph conservation, reciprocal edges, ordering, reserved metadata, and zero I/O on invalid input; malformed/deep/cyclic/extension corpora fail typed and leave the connection usable |
| Mutation                 | A pinned native mutation engine challenges the pure flow planner of every SDK except TypeScript (no engine, fast-check only) on scheduled/manual CI; surviving non-equivalent mutants require a stronger invariant                      |
| Chaos / recovery         | Hard process termination, half-open timeout, reconnect and durable-job visibility after restart                                                                                                                                         |
| Load / spike             | Bounded bulk and worker bursts run in the normal gate, including 512-1500 job spikes                                                                                                                                                    |
| Soak / stress            | One long-lived SDK connection repeatedly adds, queries, and resets batches for a configurable duration and batch size                                                                                                                   |
| Security / compatibility | Auth-first and CA-verification regressions, weekly dependency advisories, and the runtime version matrix in `.github/workflows/sdk.yml`                                                                                                 |

The bounded cases belong in `test:sandbox:sdk`. Sustained profiles are opt-in
because hours-long tests are not a useful per-edit gate. They run weekly in CI
for 900 seconds per SDK and can be reproduced natively:

```bash
BUNQUEUE_SDK_SOAK_SECONDS=3600 BUNQUEUE_SDK_SOAK_BATCH=100 bun sdk/typescript/tests/soak.ts
BUNQUEUE_SDK_SOAK_SECONDS=3600 BUNQUEUE_SDK_SOAK_BATCH=100 python sdk/python/tests/soak.py
BUNQUEUE_SDK_SOAK_SECONDS=3600 BUNQUEUE_SDK_SOAK_BATCH=100 php sdk/php/tests/soak.php
BUNQUEUE_SDK_SOAK_SECONDS=3600 BUNQUEUE_SDK_SOAK_BATCH=100 \
  go test ./sdk/go -run '^TestSDKSoak$' -timeout 3900s -v
BUNQUEUE_SDK_SOAK_SECONDS=3600 BUNQUEUE_SDK_SOAK_BATCH=100 \
  cargo test --manifest-path sdk/rust/Cargo.toml --test soak -- --ignored
BUNQUEUE_SDK_SOAK_SECONDS=3600 BUNQUEUE_SDK_SOAK_BATCH=100 \
  sh -c 'cd sdk/elixir && mix test --include soak --timeout 3900000 test/soak_test.exs'
```

Go and Elixir are the two runners with a framework timeout shorter than a soak:
`go test` panics at 10 minutes and ExUnit kills a test at 60 seconds, both
regardless of how long the profile is asked to run. Always pass a bound larger
than `BUNQUEUE_SDK_SOAK_SECONDS` (the examples add 300 seconds of slack for
broker startup and teardown); the weekly CI steps derive theirs from the same
variable. The other runners have no implicit test timeout.

Raise `BUNQUEUE_SDK_SOAK_BATCH` to explore client backpressure and the practical
breaking point. That is a diagnostic stress profile, not a stable performance
threshold. Go also exposes `FuzzHardeningPortableWirePayload`; CI fuzzes it for
60 seconds weekly. All SDKs keep deterministic malformed-input corpora in the
normal gate; these are separate from mutation testing, which rewrites planner
code and therefore runs in its own scheduled/manual campaign after the normal
suite is green.

`.github/workflows/sdk-mutation.yml` is that campaign. It pins every mutation
engine, retains the machine-readable/native report, and must never weaken a
language's checked-in ratchet at the command line. The current minimums are
97% for mutmut, 100% for Muex, 99% MSI/covered MSI for
Infection, and 99.9% efficacy/coverage for Gremlins. `cargo-mutants` fails on
every viable survivor. A score above a ratchet is not sufficient by itself:
every survivor is classified as a missing assertion or a behaviorally
equivalent mutation, and non-equivalent survivors require a stronger property
before handoff.

Database power-loss, disk-full, WAL integrity, and schema upgrade/downgrade
tests belong to the broker's persistence suite, not to network clients that
cannot control SQLite. SDK crash tests assert the client-visible contract:
durable work survives broker SIGKILL, reconnect succeeds, and the job remains
queryable exactly once. Delivery remains at-least-once; processors must be
idempotent because a crash after side effects but before ACK can re-run a job.

Disk-full admission assertions are fail closed: when an immediate durable
write is rejected, the candidate must be absent from SQLite, queue heaps,
dependency wait sets, `jobIndex`, counters, custom-ID/dedup ownership, queries,
and Worker delivery. A rejected terminal-ID reuse must preserve the old
completed/DLQ generation and result before and after restart. Buffered writes
have a different documented contract: they may be acknowledged before their
10 ms flush and must surface later failure through storage health, retry, and
critical-loss reporting.

Weekly dependency audits require live advisory databases and therefore run in
CI, not inside the deliberately offline sandbox. Performance-regression
thresholds likewise use fresh native processes; Docker/VM measurements are
diagnostic only and must never be published as benchmark results.

## Test image

`Dockerfile.test` is deliberately separate from the production `Dockerfile`.
The production image contains only the compiled server; the test image contains
`src/`, `test/`, `scripts/`, `bench/`, configuration, internal technical
Markdown, and the Astro documentation content exercised by documentation
contracts. Copying the documentation is intentional: section coverage,
language-tab parity, and stale architecture-reference checks must execute in
the sandbox instead of passing vacuously against an empty tree. The allow-listed
configuration also includes `docs/vercel.json`, the CI workflow files, and the
two Compose manifests, plus the small per-SDK mutation configuration files
consumed by structural regressions. The PostgreSQL manifest is required by the
credential-safety test. The image includes `Dockerfile.test` itself so tests can
verify that this contract stays synchronized with the workflow files, and the
production `Dockerfile` so the release preflight regression checks the real
variant build inputs instead of a missing file. It does
not install SDK toolchains or copy credentials into the core test image.
`Dockerfile.test.dockerignore` limits the build context to those inputs.

Regression helpers that poll state must fail closed when their deadline expires.
Tests concerned with failure classification rather than scheduling explicitly
set `backoff: 0`, so randomized production retry jitter cannot turn an incomplete
observation into a misleading downstream assertion. Migration regressions always
verify the current schema version; schema 30 also has a direct 29-to-30 upgrade
test for the durable `jobs.dlq_retry_state` column.

PostgreSQL Fast Check scopes delete every generated namespace in one set-based
transaction and use an explicit database-hook timeout. Deep campaigns therefore
retain complete cleanup without opening one pool per generated case or depending
on Bun's short default hook deadline.

PostgreSQL lifecycle regressions use explicit post-commit barriers rather than
timing guesses. They pause admission, claim, relationship mutation, and startup
hydration between durable commit and local refresh, start shutdown, and assert
that the accepted operation settles before the pool closes. Companion cases
prove that a 60-second empty long-poll does not own lifecycle admission, late
synchronous writes fail at the gate, and disconnect cleanup remains harmless.
Projection regressions inject failures after a durable push or ACK and assert
both that public success is preserved and that bounded background repair
restores a healthy local snapshot. Projection-health regressions
(`test/repro-postgres-direct-projection-clears-health.test.ts` without a
database, `test/postgres-projection-health-recovery.test.ts` against
PostgreSQL) record a refresh failure whose retry is still pending, then prove
that a lease renewal, batched completion, local claim, or queue refresh that
supersedes it clears the per-job health key so `/ready` returns 200, that a
cancelled or fenced-out ticket leaves the error to its repair refresh, and that
a failed job read re-queues a retry. Additional deterministic cases keep a direct
claim token across delayed journal replay, retry every captured client lease
after a transient release error, bound repeated startup-buffer overflow, stop
queue refresh under continuous event-version churn, serialize each maintenance
subsystem, and prove store close awaits admitted maintenance.
Event-retention regressions hold the per-queue advisory lock while a committed
writer requests an autonomous trim. They assert that normal contention leaves
storage health intact, one coalesced retry restores the exact retained window
after release, and close cancels the pending timer without issuing a late SQL
query. The existing two-broker campaign still drives 5,000 jobs through 16
consumers and requires the 32-event window to converge within five seconds.
Direct-child removal tests exercise two managers against one database and assert
pending-state coverage, exact event emission, idempotence, active/terminal lease
and result retention, plus fixed-point protection for shared dependency graphs.

PostgreSQL cron overlap tests disable incidental maintenance ticks, observe the
durable `next_run` against the database clock, and accept either competing broker
as the `SKIP LOCKED` winner. They do not infer scheduler correctness from a fixed
host sleep or require one named broker to win a valid race.

Wall-clock backoff tests assert the lower bound of each retry's own jitter
window. They never require adjacent exponential delays to be monotonic: the
documented ±50% windows overlap, so a valid second delay can be shorter than a
valid first delay. Unit tests cover the exact random-factor bounds and cap,
while TCP and embedded runners prove that real retry admission respects the
per-attempt floors.

The environment is reproducible:

- Bun is pinned to 1.4.2, matching CI, the SDK gates, and the release build environment.
- Dependencies use `bun install --frozen-lockfile --ignore-scripts`.
- Timezone is UTC and the process runs as the image's non-root `bun` user.
- OpenSSL is installed because the TLS regression suites generate certificates.

## Runtime containment

`scripts/test-sandbox.ts` builds the image once, then starts one container per
suite concurrently. Parallelism reduces wall-clock time to approximately the
slowest suite instead of the sum of all three durations. Inside the unit
container, Bun additionally distributes test files across four isolated worker
processes; the TCP and embedded script runners retain their own sequencing.
Each container has:

- no host bind mounts, Docker socket, home directory, or credentials;
- no external network (`--network none`); TCP/HTTP integration uses loopback;
- all Linux capabilities dropped and `no-new-privileges` enabled;
- PID and memory limits, plus the Docker daemon's CPU ceiling;
- an isolated executable `/tmp` tmpfs for SQLite files and sandboxed workers;
- `--init`, a stop timeout, signal cleanup, and automatic removal after success.

The separate SDK sandbox keeps the same no-mount, dropped-capability, resource,
and credential boundaries. Its six suite containers join a unique
Docker-internal network solely to reach one disposable PostgreSQL 18.6 service;
the network has no external route. Each language's conformance runner exercises
SQLite and PostgreSQL sequentially with distinct broker storage, while the six
languages still run in parallel. Successful completion removes the service and
network; a failed run retains them with the logs for diagnosis.

Every run writes the complete, untruncated output of each suite below
`artifacts/test-sandbox/<timestamp>/`. The directory is ignored by Git. On
failure the runner prints the exact log path and retains the failed container,
so the result remains inspectable with `docker logs <container>`; remove it with
`docker rm <container>` after diagnosis.

## Telemetry and engineering KPIs

Every sandbox run emits machine-readable telemetry alongside the complete logs:

```text
artifacts/test-sandbox/<timestamp>/
├── unit|tcp|embedded.log
├── unit|tcp|embedded.metrics.ndjson
├── unit|tcp|embedded.summary.json
├── summary.json
└── summary.md
```

`docker stats` is sampled throughout each suite. Suite summaries contain wall
time, exit code, OOM status, CPU average/p95/peak, memory start/end/delta/p95/
peak/limit/slope, peak PID count, block I/O, network I/O, and pass/fail/skip
counts. TCP and embedded runners also emit one structured record per test file
with its duration and assertion totals. Unit output is parsed into individual
test names and durations, which powers the slow-test ranking in `summary.md`.
That human-readable report also surfaces sample counts, observed tests per
second, the complete memory profile and slope, block I/O, and network I/O; the
JSON and NDJSON artifacts remain the authoritative machine-readable values.
SDK summaries combine each language's native test result with shared
conformance checks. For Elixir, the current `Result: N passed` summary is
authoritative (including failed/skipped fields when present); the legacy
`N tests, M failures` format is parsed only when no current summary exists, so
mixed logs are not double-counted.

The report flags non-zero exits, OOM kills, memory or PID pressure above 80%, a
strong end-to-start memory-growth signal, and material duration or peak-memory
regressions against the most recent prior telemetry report. Raw samples remain
in NDJSON so an anomaly can be correlated with timestamps in the suite log.

Memory is measured at container level. Individual unit tests share a process,
heap, caches, and garbage collector, so assigning heap ownership to one test
would be misleading. A positive memory slope is a signal to investigate, not
proof of a leak; confirm it with a focused repeated-process reproduction and
post-GC measurements before changing runtime code.

The disposable container layer may be writable because a few tests generate
temporary scripts below the repository path. It cannot write those changes back
to the host because no repository path is mounted.

Resource defaults can be adjusted for constrained machines without changing the
image:

```bash
BUNQUEUE_TEST_MEMORY=4g BUNQUEUE_TEST_CPUS=1 bun run test:sandbox
```

`BUNQUEUE_TEST_CPUS` adds a stricter per-container CPU cap when desired;
otherwise the runner inherits the daemon's configured CPU ceiling.
`BUNQUEUE_TEST_IMAGE` changes the local image tag. The default memory ceiling is
4 GB per container. Use `BUNQUEUE_TEST_SEQUENTIAL=1` to run the same isolated
suites one after another when diagnosing a possible resource-contention failure.
Functional tests that depend on background timers must poll the observable state
with a generous deadline. A fixed sleep proves only that a minimum duration
elapsed; it does not bound when a timer callback runs under parallel CPU or I/O
contention.

## TCP suite isolation

`scripts/tcp/run-all-tests.ts` is safe to run either natively or inside the
sandbox. For every `test-*.ts` file it:

1. allocates fresh TCP and HTTP ports;
2. creates a unique temporary directory and SQLite database;
3. starts a new server with a small allowlist of inherited environment values;
4. runs one test file with an explicit timeout;
5. emits a structured duration/result marker for telemetry;
6. terminates the test and server, then removes the whole temporary directory.

This prevents queue state, completed-job caches, timers, environment variables,
or a server shutdown in one file from affecting another file. Authentication is
enabled only for the authentication suite. `BUNQUEUE_TEST_FILE_TIMEOUT_MS`
overrides the default three-minute per-file bound.

Every TCP fixture runs against SQLite. `GetJobs` is intentionally eventually
consistent with non-durable `PUSH` while the roughly 10 ms write buffer drains,
so tests that assert an immediate list/filter/pagination result must seed those
jobs with `durable: true`. Do not replace that guarantee with a fixed sleep;
tests specifically covering buffered visibility should poll with a deadline.

## CI

GitHub Actions already gives each job a fresh virtual machine, so the unit, TCP,
and embedded jobs remain parallel rather than starting nested Docker. They use
the same pinned Bun version and frozen lockfile as the local sandbox. A CI job is
the isolation equivalent of one local suite container. The unit job runs
`bun test --parallel=4`, matching both `bun run test` and the sandbox unit
container.

`test-core-e2e` runs `bun run test:core-e2e` as a distinct required job. Its
TypeScript-compiler inventory currently covers 326 public instance methods
across Queue, Worker, Job, schedulers, DLQ, FlowProducer, QueueGroup, Bunqueue,
SandboxedWorker, Forwarder, Workflow, Engine, event facades, and
TcpConnectionPool. Exported runtime classes are discovered automatically. The
290 dual-mode methods use a fresh embedded SQLite manager and a real
dynamic-port TCP broker with a separate SQLite database; the 13 transport-only
pool methods carry embedded `N/A`, and 23 synchronous snapshots with async
counterparts carry TCP `N/A`.
The suite scans its contracts for test doubles and compares successful coverage
to the applicable discovered surface exactly. It exposes 616 applicable
method-mode checks and uploads the full 326-row Markdown/JSON evidence matrix as
a CI artifact. See
[Core Public API End-to-End Matrix](./features/core-public-api-e2e.md).

`.github/workflows/sdk.yml` is both reusable and directly schedulable. CI calls
it once and waits for an explicit `sdk-gate` that checks the result of all six
language jobs even when an earlier one failed or was cancelled. A root
`quality-gate` similarly checks the public-API E2E job plus every other core,
docs, SDK, and PostgreSQL compatibility result. `test-postgres` is both a
declared `needs` dependency and an explicitly checked result, so a failed or
cancelled PostgreSQL 18.6/17/16/15 matrix cannot leave the release DAG green.
Expiry boundary cases derive timestamps from the PostgreSQL clock so
host/container clock skew cannot turn lifecycle coverage into a timing-only
failure. The version gate, binary matrix, container publication, and GitHub release are all
transitively downstream; Docker publication also waits for the complete binary
matrix. Each successful Docker release publishes the exact package version
alongside `latest` and the variant aliases, so production deployments can pin
the same version as npm without losing the moving convenience tag.
The same multi-platform build (`linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`) publishes these
tags to both `ghcr.io/egeominotti/bunqueue` and `docker.io/egeominotti/bunqueue`.
Native image staging tags and the full-SHA variant index exist only on GHCR and
are named after the release source commit (`source_sha`).
Docker Hub receives a copy of the completed GHCR index with public version and
variant aliases. Neither registry receives new timestamp tags. The publication
regression executes the workflow shell with a recording Docker stub to verify
the registry destinations and the index-copy source without remote writes.
Docker Hub authentication uses the GitHub Actions repository secrets
`DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` and `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`; the token must have write access to
`egeominotti/bunqueue`. GHCR continues to use `GITHUB_TOKEN`. A Docker Hub login
or push failure fails the Docker job and blocks the downstream GitHub release.
Normal pushes skip already released versions. A manual CI run on main with
`rebuild_docker=true` repeats the quality and binary gates and republishes Docker
images for the current package version without editing its GitHub release/tag.

Every published artifact of a run comes from one commit. The version gate
outputs `source_sha`: the pushed commit for a new version, or, when the tag
`v<version>` already exists (rebuild or npm publication), that tag's commit,
with annotated tags dereferenced through their peeled `^{}` ref. The gate
fetches the tag commit and fails unless its `package.json` carries the same
version; an unresolvable commit or non-40-hex value also fails. The binary
build, image test, Docker publication, npm, and release jobs check out exactly
`source_sha`, and the binary build asserts `git rev-parse HEAD` because an empty
checkout ref would silently use the triggering commit. Images carry
`org.opencontainers.image.revision`/`version` labels that are verified before
export, and the GitHub release passes `target_commitish: source_sha` so a commit
landing on main during the pipeline cannot move the new tag. The quality gate
keeps testing the triggering commit; a rebuilt tag was gated at its release.
Rebuilding runs the current workflow against the tagged tree, so a tag missing
newer build inputs fails loudly: `v2.9.5`, for instance, has no Docker variant
stages or image test and stops at the image-test preflight.
`test/repro-release-source-commit.test.ts` executes the gate, label check,
preflight, and staging-tag scripts against Git/Docker stubs.
The four-variant native amd64/arm64 image test matrix must pass in full before
publication. It exports the tested images; publishing loads those exact archives
instead of rebuilding. See [Docker images](./features/docker-images.md) for the
offline smoke checks, tag mapping, and artifact lifecycle.
The optional manual `npm_version` input must exactly match `package.json` and
also requests the Docker rebuild path. The root npm job waits for the binary
and Docker gates, checks out `source_sha` (the existing tag's commit when that
version is already tagged), verifies that the registry returns 404 for that version,
rechecks the packed consumer contract, and publishes its saved tarball through
npm trusted publishing. Publication is split in two jobs so the publish
credential never reaches code that installs dependencies or runs tests:
`npm-pack` (`contents: read`, no credential) verifies, smoke-tests, packs and
uploads the tarball; `npm` runs in the GitHub environment `npm` with only
`id-token: write`, checks out nothing, downloads that tarball and publishes it.
npm exchanges the GitHub OIDC token for a short-lived publish credential
(trusted publisher: `ci.yml`, environment `npm`), so no long-lived npm token
exists. The npm CLI is pinned (>= 11.5.1, checked at runtime) because Bun's
publisher has no OIDC support; it runs `npm publish --dry-run` and then
`npm publish --provenance --ignore-scripts` on the same tarball. Because the
provenance attestation records the triggering commit, `npm-pack` refuses to
publish when `source_sha` (an already tagged version's commit) differs from
`GITHUB_SHA`. Dispatch the npm publication while main still points at the
release commit; once later commits have landed, bump the version and publish
the new release instead.
Network errors and already published versions fail closed. Normal pushes and
manual runs with a blank npm version cannot publish to npm.
The binary matrix builds eight standalone targets: Linux glibc and musl, macOS,
and Windows, each for x64 and arm64. Linux/macOS assets are compressed as
`.tar.gz`; Windows assets use `.zip`. All eight archives appear in the release
download table and `SHA256SUMS`. Before the release is created, the `release`
job attests SLSA build provenance for every archive with `actions/attest`
(keyless Sigstore, `id-token: write` + `attestations: write`), verifiable with
`gh attestation verify <archive> --repo egeominotti/bunqueue`; images are signed
by the separate `docker-sbom` and `docker-attest` jobs (see
[Docker images](./features/docker-images.md)). Missing binaries
or unmatched release assets fail publication rather than producing an
incomplete release. Cross-compilation
alone does not establish native runtime compatibility on each target.
`test/repro-release-sdk-gate.test.ts` locks both the version and `latest` tags.
The TypeScript package publisher (`.github/workflows/sdk-release.yml`) is
manual, runs the same reusable six-SDK gate, uses frozen installs and pinned
Bun, and creates its `sdk-ts-v<version>` tag only after the registry accepts the
package. It packs `/tmp/typescript-package/bunqueue-client-<version>.tgz`,
validates the requested version, requires Git exit status 2 for an absent tag
and an explicit registry 404 for an unpublished version (network or
authentication errors stop it), then runs `npm publish --dry-run` on that
tarball and publishes the same tarball with `npm publish --provenance`. Like the
root npm job it is split: `pack` builds and validates with no credential, and
`publish` (environment `npm`, `id-token: write` plus `contents: write` for the
tag, trusted publisher `sdk-release.yml`) runs no repository code, publishes the
downloaded tarball and tags the commit `pack` built. No npm token exists.
`test/repro-sdk-release-auth.test.ts` and `test/npm-publication-workflow.test.ts`
lock both jobs.

Every third-party `uses:` in `.github/workflows/` is pinned to a full 40-hex
commit SHA with the resolved release in a trailing comment (for example
`actions/checkout@<sha> # v4.4.0`); only local reusable workflows
(`./.github/workflows/*.yml`) use paths. Pins stay on the major version
previously referenced and are resolved with
`git ls-remote --tags https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>`, dereferencing annotated
tags through `^{}`. `dtolnay/rust-toolchain` selects its toolchain by ref name,
so it is pinned to a `master` commit with an explicit `toolchain:` input
(`1.85.0` or `stable`, matching the former refs). To update a pin, resolve the
new release the same way and change the SHA and comment together in every
workflow; `test/repro-workflow-action-pinning.test.ts` rejects mutable refs,
missing release comments, divergent pins of one action, and implicit Rust
toolchains.

The finite release-DAG relationships are parsed and mutation-checked by
`test/repro-release-sdk-gate.test.ts`; actionlint validates the full GitHub
Actions syntax and reusable-workflow contracts in the lint job. Actionlint
delegates embedded shell snippets to `shellcheck` only when that executable is
available, so the regression suite also rejects unquoted redirections to
GitHub command files independently of the developer machine. For direct
ShellCheck parity without a host installation, validate an individual workflow
through the pinned image without mounting the repository:

```bash
docker run --rm -i rhysd/actionlint:1.7.12 - < .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

Property-based testing is deliberately not used for this small finite edge set.

## Benchmarks are native

Do not publish performance figures produced in Docker Desktop or another VM.
Virtualized CPU scheduling, networking, and filesystems distort both latency
and throughput. Benchmark runners must instead use native processes with a new
server, database, queue names, ports, and competitor state for every sample.
Never reuse a developer Redis database or a long-lived bunqueue server.

Docker Compose is reserved for functional tests that genuinely need external
services. Use a unique Compose project name and disposable volumes; never run a
repository-wide `down -v` against an unrelated project.

### PostgreSQL 15–18 native matrix

`bun run bench:postgres:versions` compares native PostgreSQL 15 through 18
across one, two, and four independent broker processes. It must not be run in a
container or VM for documentation figures. By default it submits 10,000 jobs
per sample with four producers, 16 fixed consumers, batch size 100, one
discarded warm-up, and seven measured samples per version/topology cell.

Every sample owns a new `initdb` data directory, database, PostgreSQL process,
broker processes, dynamic ports, namespace, and queue. The runner keeps
`fsync`, `synchronous_commit`, and `full_page_writes` enabled, rotates version
and topology order between rounds, and rejects missing/duplicate IDs,
nonterminal rows, command failures, PostgreSQL deadlocks, or process failures.
Raw JSON is written under `artifacts/benchmarks/`. Artifacts used by a published
PostgreSQL report are copied byte-for-byte into
`docs/public/benchmarks/postgres/<campaign-date>/`, indexed by a tracked manifest,
and verified against their documented SHA-256 hashes.
