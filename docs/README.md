# bunqueue — Internal Technical Documentation

This folder is the **internal engineering reference** for bunqueue: a deep, code-accurate description of every subsystem, intended for contributors and operators who need to understand _how the system actually works_.

> **Scope.** This is distinct from the user-facing documentation site that lives under [`src/content/docs/`](./src/content/docs/) (an Astro Starlight site published to the web) and from the release [`changelog`](./src/content/docs/changelog.md). The site teaches _how to use_ bunqueue; this reference explains _how bunqueue is built_. Both must stay in sync with the code (see [Keeping these docs in sync](#keeping-these-docs-in-sync)).

bunqueue is a high-performance job queue for [Bun](https://bun.sh): the default
single-process engine uses sharded in-memory priority queues backed by a
write-behind SQLite store, while an optional PostgreSQL 15–18 server engine uses
database-authoritative transactions and leases for multi-broker deployments;
18.6 is the pinned and recommended release.
Both are fronted by binary-TCP and HTTP transports; the project also includes an
embedded SDK (`Queue`/`Worker`), a saga workflow engine, and a native MCP server
for AI agents.

## Feature reference (`features/`)

Each module has one file documenting its purpose, responsibilities, dependencies, public interface (real signatures / TCP commands / HTTP endpoints / events), data models, control flow with `path:line` citations, concurrency behavior, edge cases & failure modes, and configuration.

## How the source maps to these docs

The runtime lives under [`src/`](../src) and follows a layered architecture (see [Architecture](./architecture.md)):

```
src/
├── domain/          # Pure business logic & types (Shard, PriorityQueue, DlqShard, types)
├── application/     # Use cases: QueueManager, operations/, managers, background tasks
├── infrastructure/  # External edges: SQLite/PostgreSQL persistence, servers, scheduler, backup, cloud
├── client/          # Embedded SDK: queue/, worker/, tcp/, workflow/, bunqueue (simple mode), forwarder
├── shared/          # Utilities: hash, lock, semaphore, lru/bounded/ttl maps, skipList, minHeap, histogram
├── cli/             # Command-line interface
├── mcp/             # Native MCP server + tools
└── config/          # Config resolution + entrypoint glue
```

Source directories under `src/benchmark/`, `bench/`, and `test/` are tooling
rather than runtime feature modules. They are covered by [Test
Isolation](./testing.md), the _Performance Characteristics_ and _Reliability &
Battle-Testing_ sections of [Architecture](./architecture.md), and the
reproducible reports under `benchmarks/`.

Documentation tooling spans `docs/scripts/` and `docs/src/lib/`. The Open Graph
generator separates cover definitions from rendering; `reference-seo.ts` adds
current API canonicals, metadata and social images, while `sitemap.ts` owns
sitemap priorities and `src/routeData.ts` removes a repeated brand suffix from
page titles.
Shared documentation navigation, reading styles and homepage onboarding live in
`docs/src/components/` and `docs/src/styles/`, including the simulated hero
queue in `home/HomeLedger.astro`, the Docker variant selector in
`home/HomeDockerQuickstart.astro`, the bunqueue Academy video course in
`home/HomeAcademy.astro` (episodes declared in `src/data/academy.ts`, played
through the click-to-load `VideoPlayer.astro`), the web dashboard introduction in
`home/HomeDashboard.astro` and the public-project list in
`home/HomeUsedBy.astro`; see
[Documentation Tooling](./features/documentation-tooling.md).

The Queue query split (`operations/query.ts`, `queryStates.ts`, and
`queryTcpPages.ts`) is documented in [Client SDK: Queue](./features/client-queue-sdk.md).
The job-admission split (`operations/push.ts`, `pushBatch.ts`,
`pushAdmission.ts`, `customId.ts`, `pushDeduplication.ts`, and `parentLink.ts`)
is documented in [Job Lifecycle](./features/job-lifecycle.md), with its
`persistence/sqlite/admission.ts` transaction contract documented in
[Persistence](./features/persistence.md).
The pull split between orchestration, atomic dequeue state, and durable handoff
is implemented by `operations/pull.ts`, `operations/pullStateTransition.ts`,
and [`operations/pullFinalization.ts`](../src/application/operations/pullFinalization.ts).
SQLite batch telemetry semantics live in
[`persistence/sqlite/telemetryWrites.ts`](../src/infrastructure/persistence/sqlite/telemetryWrites.ts),
with statement/transaction lifetime and exact retention counts isolated in
[`persistence/sqlite/telemetryStore.ts`](../src/infrastructure/persistence/sqlite/telemetryStore.ts);
both are documented in the same lifecycle and persistence references.
Buffered admission/state transitions are isolated in
[`persistence/sqlite/jobLifecycle.ts`](../src/infrastructure/persistence/sqlite/jobLifecycle.ts),
while [`writeBufferPending.ts`](../src/infrastructure/persistence/writeBufferPending.ts)
owns pending-buffer lookup, removal, and explicit lifecycle-state stamping.
SQLite-authoritative completed cleanup is split between
[`application/completedCleanup.ts`](../src/application/completedCleanup.ts) and
[`persistence/sqlite/completed.ts`](../src/infrastructure/persistence/sqlite/completed.ts),
with exact counters/triggers in
[`completedJobCountSchema.ts`](../src/infrastructure/persistence/completedJobCountSchema.ts).
Cold completed-job retry is isolated in
[`application/completedRetry.ts`](../src/application/completedRetry.ts); it
reads SQLite in bounded oldest-first pages instead of depending on the hot
completed cache.
The final queue-name reconciliation lives in
[`application/emptyQueueCleanup.ts`](../src/application/emptyQueueCleanup.ts): it
keeps durable completed-only queues discoverable while removing their names
after the last row disappears, without discarding live jobs, explicit policies,
or push/batch/flow admissions that are still in flight. Expired temporary rate
limits and DLQ/stall configurations equal to the defaults do not pin an empty
queue.
Observable resumable startup upgrades are coordinated by
[`sqliteMigration.ts`](../src/infrastructure/persistence/sqliteMigration.ts),
using the durable table from
[`migrationProgressSchema.ts`](../src/infrastructure/persistence/migrationProgressSchema.ts).
These modules are covered by [Persistence](./features/persistence.md),
[Background Tasks](./features/background-tasks.md), and
[Stats, Metrics & Monitoring](./features/stats-and-monitoring.md).
The optional server-only PostgreSQL runtime lives under
`persistence/postgres/`, with its manager adapter under
`application/postgres-queue-manager/`; see
[PostgreSQL 15–18 Multi-Broker Persistence](./features/postgres-multibroker.md).
That feature reference covers the `admissionStore`, its typed
[`admissionResult.ts`](../src/infrastructure/persistence/postgres/admissionResult.ts)
contract and
[`serialAdmission.ts`](../src/infrastructure/persistence/postgres/serialAdmission.ts)
reconciler, the domain-separated 64-bit lock identities in
[`advisoryLocks.ts`](../src/infrastructure/persistence/postgres/advisoryLocks.ts),
the rollback-certain core transition replay in
[`transactionRetry.ts`](../src/infrastructure/persistence/postgres/transactionRetry.ts),
completion lifecycle/query, dependency destruction, destructive
mutation, queue destruction, DLQ repair/retry-plan facades, and manager-side
Snapshot/view, terminal-delivery, and operation-gate modules added to keep lock
plans, bounded read models, and shutdown draining independently testable. The
manager constructor contract is isolated in
[`config.ts`](../src/application/postgres-queue-manager/config.ts), while
[`removeUnprocessedChildren.ts`](../src/infrastructure/persistence/postgres/removeUnprocessedChildren.ts)
owns the atomic fixed-point transaction for direct pending children and shared
consumers. Server
teardown uses `infrastructure/server/shutdownCoordinator.ts` so cleanup retries,
timeouts, duplicate signals, and exit status can be tested without binding a
production server.

## Keeping these docs in sync

> **This documentation is part of the codebase and must never drift from it.**

Per the project's [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md), **any code change must update the corresponding docs in this folder in the same change-set** — never as a follow-up:

- Touching a module → update its `features/<slug>.md` (purpose, public interface, control flow, edge cases, config).
- New module → add a `features/<slug>.md` and link it from this README and from [Architecture](./architecture.md)'s module map.
- Changing a type, SQLite table/index, TCP command, HTTP endpoint, env var, or default → update [data-model.md](./data-model.md) and the relevant feature doc.
- Adding/removing a component or changing a data flow → update [architecture.md](./architecture.md) (component diagram, flows, module map).

A code change is not complete until `/docs` reflects it.
