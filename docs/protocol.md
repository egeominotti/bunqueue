# bunqueue Wire Protocol Specification

**Protocol version: 3** · Status: stable · Last updated: 2026-08-03

This is the normative specification for writing a bunqueue client in any
language. A client that satisfies every **MUST** in this document and passes
the [conformance suite](../sdk/conformance/README.md) is protocol-conformant.

Normative source of truth for exact field names and validation bounds:
[`src/domain/types/command.ts`](../src/domain/types/command.ts) (requests),
[`src/domain/types/response.ts`](../src/domain/types/response.ts) (responses),
and the handlers in
[`src/infrastructure/server/handlers/`](../src/infrastructure/server/handlers/).
Where this document and the code disagree, the code wins and this document
has a bug: file an issue.

The words MUST / MUST NOT / SHOULD are used as in RFC 2119.

---

## 1. Transport and framing

- Transport is a plain TCP stream (optionally TLS, section 8). Default port
  `6789`.
- Every message, in both directions, is one **frame**:

  ```
  +--------------------+---------------------------+
  | u32 big-endian LEN | LEN bytes of msgpack data |
  +--------------------+---------------------------+
  ```

- The payload is **standard MessagePack** (msgpack spec, no application
  record extensions). The top-level value is always a map with string keys.
- One extension type appears in **server → client** frames: the server's
  encoder (msgpackr) serializes JavaScript `undefined` as **ext type 0**
  (1 zero byte). Clients MUST tolerate ext 0 and decode it as their null
  equivalent; strict decoders that reject unknown extensions will fail on
  otherwise-valid responses (observed on Auth and GetJob replies). Clients
  MUST NOT send ext types themselves.
- Maximum frame size is **64 MiB** (`LEN <= 67108864`). After MessagePack
  encoding and before allocating or writing the framed buffer, a client MUST
  reject a larger payload locally; the server closes connections that send
  oversized frames.
- Frames MAY be pipelined: a client may send multiple requests before reading
  responses. Responses carry the request's `reqId` back (section 3), and MAY
  arrive out of order when pipelined. A strictly sequential client can rely
  on ordering but SHOULD still match `reqId`.
- A client MUST preserve every byte and frame boundary under socket
  backpressure. If the socket write primitive accepts only a prefix, the
  client MUST retain the unwritten tail, queue later frames behind it, and
  resume from the exact offset when the socket becomes writable. It MUST NOT
  replay an old connection's buffered bytes after reconnect; the corresponding
  command may already have been applied by the server.

## 2. Session establishment

1. Open the TCP (or TLS) connection.
2. If the server was started with `AUTH_TOKENS`, the **first** command MUST
   be `{"cmd": "Auth", "token": "<token>"}`. Every other command on an
   unauthenticated connection fails. A failed `Auth` (`ok: false`) means the
   session is unusable; the client SHOULD close and surface an
   authentication error, distinct from generic command errors.
3. `Hello` is optional protocol discovery:
   request `{"cmd": "Hello", "protocolVersion": 3, "capabilities": ["pipelining", "separate-job-name"]}`,
   response `{ok, protocolVersion, capabilities, server, version}`. The
   server currently ignores the client's declared version and always answers
   with its own (`protocolVersion: 3`). Clients SHOULD expose it so version
   drift is observable.

## 3. Message envelope

Request:

```jsonc
{ "cmd": "PUSH", "reqId": "any-string" /* command fields */ }
```

Response:

```jsonc
{ "ok": true,  "reqId": "any-string", /* result fields */ }
{ "ok": false, "reqId": "any-string", "error": "human readable reason" }
```

- `reqId` is an opaque client-chosen string echoed back verbatim. It is
  optional on the wire but REQUIRED for pipelining clients.
- `ok: false` responses MUST be mapped to a typed error by the client, with
  one mandatory special case: **"not found" lookups** (section 6.2).

## 4. Data types — the int64 rule

The server decodes msgpack with `msgpackr` under a JavaScript engine:

- msgpack **int64/uint64 values decode to `BigInt`**, and any arithmetic
  that mixes them with regular numbers **crashes the server handler**
  (e.g. `ListWorkers` computing uptime from a client-sent `startedAt`).
- Therefore a client MUST NOT emit msgpack int64/uint64 anywhere in a frame
  (fields, job data, nested structures, array elements). Any integer outside
  the int32 range `[-2147483648, 2147483647]` MUST be encoded as **float64**
  instead. IEEE 754 float64 is exact up to 2^53, which covers every
  millisecond timestamp until the year 287396.
- Integers within int32 range SHOULD be sent as msgpack ints, in their most
  compact representation. Beware libraries that pick the encoding from the
  static type rather than the value (e.g. Go's `msgpack` encoding an `int64`
  variable holding `3` as a fixed int64): configure compact/smallest-form
  integer encoding, or the int64 rule above is violated for every field.
- Map keys MUST be strings.
- Binary strings SHOULD be avoided in job data (the server round-trips them,
  but cross-language behavior of msgpack `bin` vs `str` differs); prefer
  UTF-8 text or base64.

This is the single most common way to write a broken client. The reference
implementations name the guard `jsSafe` (PHP/TS) / `_js_safe` (Python); it
is applied recursively to every outgoing frame.

## 5. The job payload contract

- Protocol v3 carries the job name in the top-level `name` field on `PUSH`
  and in each `PUSHB`/`PUSHF` job input. The `data` field is the untouched
  user payload; it may be a map, scalar, list, or `null`.
- Returned `Job` values follow the same envelope: `job.name` is scheduling
  metadata and `job.data` is exactly the user payload. A user-owned `name`
  key inside `data` is never promoted, removed, or overwritten by a v3
  producer.
- For compatibility, the server accepts a legacy input with no top-level
  `name`. At that transport boundary only, an object-shaped `data` value with
  a string `name` is decoded as the old envelope and that key is removed from
  user data. If no legacy name is present, the server uses the default job
  name. Modern clients MUST always send the top-level field so arbitrary user
  data remains unambiguous.
- Reserved data keys used by flows: `__parentId`, `__parentQueue`,
  `__childrenIds`, `__flowParentId`, `__flowParentIds`. Clients MUST NOT
  strip them and SHOULD NOT let user payloads collide with them.

## 6. Command reference

Exact request field names are normative in `command.ts`. This section defines
the shapes and the rules a client MUST get right. All commands below answer
`{ok: true, ...}` unless stated.

### 6.1 Producing

| Command | Key request fields                                | Response    |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `PUSH`  | `queue`, `name`, `data`, plus job options (below) | `{id}`      |
| `PUSHB` | `queue`, `jobs: [{name, data, ...JobInput}]`      | `{ids: []}` |

Job options on `PUSH` (all optional, exact names): `priority`, `delay`,
`maxAttempts`, `backoff` (ms or `{type, delay, maxDelay}`), `ttl`, `timeout`,
`jobId`, `uniqueKey`, `dedup {ttl, extend, replace}`, `dependsOn: []`,
`parentId`, `childrenIds: []`, `tags: []`, `groupId`, `groupMaxSize`, `lifo`,
`removeOnComplete`, `removeOnFail`, `stallTimeout`, `durable`, `repeat`,
`debounceId`, `debounceTtl`, `stackTraceLimit`, `keepLogs`, `sizeLimit`,
`timestamp`, `failParentOnFailure`, `removeDependencyOnFailure`,
`ignoreDependencyOnFailure`, `continueParentOnFailure`.

Client MUSTs:

- SDK-level option names (e.g. `attempts`) MUST be renamed to the wire names
  (`maxAttempts`). A client MUST NOT silently drop an option it advertises —
  reject unknown options loudly (the "client drops a wire-supported field"
  bug class, issue #111).
- **`PUSH` vs `PUSHB` custom id asymmetry**: single `PUSH` takes `jobId`;
  `PUSHB` entries are typed `JobInput`, whose field is **`customId`**. A
  bulk client MUST rename `jobId → customId` per entry or custom ids are
  silently lost.
- `jobId` is idempotent: re-pushing an existing custom id returns the
  existing job's `id` instead of enqueuing a duplicate.
- `groupId` is the normalized job-group identifier: a non-empty string of at
  most 256 characters. Public clients may accept safe integers but MUST encode
  them as decimal strings on the wire.
- When `groupId` is present, `priority` is the BullMQ Pro intra-group priority:
  an integer from 0 through 2,097,151, served in ascending order (`0` first).
  Without `groupId`, the ordinary queue priority keeps its higher-first range.
- `groupMaxSize` is a positive safe integer. The broker checks pending depth
  and admission atomically; if any job in a `PUSHB` or `PUSHF` graph would
  exceed the limit, it rejects the complete command without partial writes.

### 6.2 Query

| Command             | Request                                                                       | Response                                                                    |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GetJob`            | `id`                                                                          | `{job}`                                                                     |
| `GetJobByCustomId`  | `queue`, `customId`                                                           | `{job}`                                                                     |
| `GetJobs`           | `queue`, `state` (string or list), `offset`, `limit`, `asc?` (default `true`) | `{jobs: []}`                                                                |
| `GetState`          | `id`                                                                          | `{state}`                                                                   |
| `GetResult`         | `id`                                                                          | `{result}`                                                                  |
| `GetProgress`       | `id`                                                                          | `{progress, message}` — top-level                                           |
| `GetJobCounts`      | `queue`                                                                       | `{counts: {waiting, prioritized, delayed, active, completed, failed, ...}}` |
| `Count`             | `queue`                                                                       | `{count}`                                                                   |
| `WaitJob`           | `id`, `timeout` (ms, **0..600000**)                                           | `{completed: bool, result?}`                                                |
| `GetLogs`           | `id`, `start?`, `end?`                                                        | `{data: {logs: []}}` — **wrapped**                                          |
| `GetChildrenValues` | `id`                                                                          | `{data: {values: {}}}` — **wrapped**                                        |

`GetResult` distinguishes a completed persisted `null` from an ID with no
result: the former returns `result: null`, while the latter has an undefined /
absent result field. Multi-result clients MUST test for absence, not truthiness,
so `0`, `false`, `""`, and `null` are retained.

Client MUSTs:

- `GetJob`, `GetJobByCustomId`, `CronGet` (and flow reads built on them)
  answer `ok: false` with an error containing "not found" for missing
  entities. The client MUST map this specific case to its language's
  null/None/nil — not throw — and MUST propagate every other error.
- `WaitJob` resolves `{completed: false}` (no result) on timeout: the client
  MUST NOT return that as a legitimate `null` result. The reference behavior
  probes `GetState`: `failed` → failure error, otherwise → timeout error.
  Timeouts beyond the server bound MUST be clamped to `[0, 600000]`, not
  forwarded.
- `GetJobs.asc=false` reverses the total createdAt/job-id ordering before
  applying `offset` and `limit`. A paginating client MUST send the same value
  on every page; omitting it preserves ascending order.
- In SQLite mode, `GetJobs` merges the authoritative runtime projection of
  accepted write-buffer jobs with persisted rows before stable pagination. A
  just-issued non-durable `PUSH` is therefore immediately visible without
  forcing a flush; `durable: true` still bypasses the application buffer.
- In PostgreSQL mode, `GetJobs` reads the broker's local projection of the
  authoritative database. The broker accepting a `PUSH`/`PUSHB` refreshes that
  projection before acknowledging the command. Other brokers converge through
  the durable outbox and `LISTEN` wakeups, with polling as the fallback, so an
  immediate cross-broker listing can briefly reflect the preceding projection.

#### Queue event stream

| Command             | Request | Response |
| ------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| `SubscribeEvents`   | `queue` | `{}`     |
| `UnsubscribeEvents` | none    | `{}`     |

One TCP connection can subscribe to one queue at a time. A new subscription
replaces the previous queue; unsubscribe leaves the connection usable for
normal commands. Matching lifecycle events are server-initiated frames:

```text
{ type: "event", event: JobEvent }
```

They carry no `reqId`. A pipelined client MUST recognize this envelope before
request correlation and MUST NOT resolve an in-flight command with it.

### 6.3 Consuming (the worker loop)

| Command            | Request                                                                              | Response                                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PULL`             | `queue`, `owner`, `timeout?` (long-poll ms), `lockTtl?`, `group?`                    | `{job, token}` — top-level, both `null`-ish when empty          |
| `PULLB`            | `queue`, `count` (**1..1000**), `timeout?` (0..60000), `owner`, `lockTtl?`, `group?` | `{jobs: [], tokens: []}`                                        |
| `ACK`              | `id`, `token`, `result?`                                                             | `{}` or `{data: {applied: false, reason: "already-finalized"}}` |
| `ACKB`             | `ids: []`, `tokens: []`, `results?`                                                  | `{}` or `{data: {ignoredIds, ignoredIndices}}`                  |
| `FAIL`             | `id`, `token`, `error`, `stack?: string[]`, `unrecoverable?: bool`                   | `{}` or `{data: {applied: false, reason: "already-finalized"}}` |
| `Heartbeat`        | `id` (= workerId), `activeJobs`, `processed`, `failed`                               | `{data: {ok: true}}`                                            |
| `JobHeartbeatB`    | `ids: []`, `tokens: []`                                                              | `{data: {ok, count}}` — renews the jobs' locks                  |
| `RegisterWorker`   | `workerId`, `name`, `queues: []`, `concurrency`, `hostname`, `pid`, `startedAt`      | `{data: {...}}`                                                 |
| `UnregisterWorker` | `workerId`                                                                           | `{data: {removed: true}}`                                       |
| `ExtendLock`       | `id`, `token`, `duration`                                                            | `{}`                                                            |
| `Progress`         | `id`, `progress` (0..100 by client convention; not server-enforced), `message?`      | `{}` — job MUST be active                                       |
| `AddLog`           | `id`, `message`, `level?` (default `info`)                                           | `{data: {added}}` — **wrapped**; read back via `GetLogs`        |

Semantics a client MUST implement:

- **Lease model.** A pulled job carries a lock `token`. `ACK`/`FAIL` MUST
  send it back. Locks expire after `lockTtl` (default 30000 ms) unless
  renewed via `JobHeartbeatB`/`ExtendLock`; an expired lock re-queues the
  job (at-least-once delivery).
- **`PULLB.count` MUST be clamped to 1..1000.** The server rejects larger
  counts; an unclamped worker with high concurrency wedges itself in a
  permanent error loop.
- `group`, when present, is
  `{concurrency?: positiveSafeInteger, limit?: {max: positiveSafeInteger,
duration: positiveSafeInteger}}`. Omission means unlimited group concurrency
  and no per-group rate window. These are broker defaults for every group, not
  client-local gates; stored group-specific overrides apply only when the
  corresponding default is present.
- `FAIL` and explicit failure paths require the job to be **ACTIVE** (pulled,
  valid token). Likewise `Progress` only works on active jobs.
- **Stack truncation direction.** The server persists the FIRST
  `stackTraceLimit` lines (default 10) of the `stack` array. A client MUST
  order the array so the exception message and throw site are within those
  first lines (JS/PHP/Go traces lead with the throw site; Python tracebacks
  end with it, so send the LAST lines, at most as many as the server keeps).
- `unrecoverable: true` skips remaining retries and dead-letters the job.
- A heartbeat interval of `0` (or negative/non-finite) at the SDK surface
  MUST disable heartbeats — never turn into a zero-delay loop.
- Worker registration is **per-connection server state**: after any
  reconnect the client MUST re-send `RegisterWorker`, or `skipIfNoWorker`
  schedulers silently stop firing (discussion #103 class). In PostgreSQL
  multi-broker mode, `Heartbeat` and `UnregisterWorker` are fenced by the
  server-derived broker and connection identities; another connection cannot
  mutate a registration merely by knowing its worker ID.
- Completion callbacks/events MUST be gated on the `ACK`/`FAIL` actually
  reaching the server. If the send fails, the lock expiry retries the job:
  claiming completion would be a lie.
- A broker timeout or retired cron generation can win while the processor is
  still returning. In that case `ACK`/`FAIL` succeeds with
  `{applied:false, reason:"already-finalized"}` and the client MUST suppress
  its local terminal event. `ACKB` reports the same condition positionally in
  `ignoredIndices`; clients MUST NOT infer it from `ignoredIds` because a batch
  may contain the same job ID more than once. Wrong/missing lease tokens and
  unrelated missing jobs remain errors.

### 6.4 Control

`Pause`/`Resume`/`IsPaused` (`{paused}` top-level), `Drain` (`{count}`),
`Clean` (`grace`, `limit`, `state` → `{ids}`), `Obliterate`, `Cancel` (by
`id`), `Discard` (`id`, `token?`), `Promote`, `PromoteJobs`, `MoveToWait` (= "retry job"),
`MoveToDelayed`, `ChangePriority`, `ChangeDelay`, `Update` (job data),
`UpdateParent` (`childId`, `parentId`).

`MoveToWait`, `MoveToDelayed`, `MoveToWaitingChildren`, `ChangeDelay`, and
`Discard` accept `token?: string`. When the target is active and has a broker
lease, the exact current token is required; unlocked jobs retain the
administrative form. Worker processor Job objects bind that token automatically
for the tokenless public `retry()`, `changeDelay(delay)`, and synchronous
`discard()` methods. For a failed job, PostgreSQL `MoveToWait` executes the
durable DLQ retry transaction; memory/SQLite retains the existing synchronous
retry path.

#### Job groups

All group getters and controls require `queue` and a normalized `groupId`,
except `GetGroupsJobsCount`, which needs only `queue` and accepts compatibility
field `maxCount?`:

| Command                  | Additional request fields | Wrapped `data` response            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `GetGroupJobsCount`      | —                         | `{count}`                          |
| `GetGroupsJobsCount`     | `maxCount?`               | `{count}`                          |
| `GetGroupActiveCount`    | —                         | `{count}`                          |
| `SetGroupRateLimit`      | `max`, `duration`         | none                               |
| `GetGroupRateLimit`      | —                         | `{limit: {max, duration} \| null}` |
| `RemoveGroupRateLimit`   | —                         | `{removed: 0 \| 1}`                |
| `GetGroupRateLimitTtl`   | `maxJobs?`                | `{ttl}`                            |
| `SetGroupConcurrency`    | `concurrency`             | none                               |
| `GetGroupConcurrency`    | —                         | `{concurrency: number \| null}`    |
| `RemoveGroupConcurrency` | —                         | `{removed: 0 \| 1}`                |
| `PauseGroup`             | —                         | `{changed: boolean}`               |
| `ResumeGroup`            | —                         | `{changed: boolean}`               |
| `IsGroupPaused`          | —                         | `{paused: boolean}`                |
| `RateLimitGroup`         | `duration`                | none                               |

`max`, `duration`, and `concurrency` are positive safe integers. Group depth
counts waiting, prioritized, and delayed grouped jobs, excluding active jobs.
The scheduler serves ungrouped work first, then ascending priority within each
group with FIFO ties, and round-robin across groups. `PauseGroup` blocks only
new claims for that group. `RateLimitGroup` installs an immediately effective
manual deadline independent of a Worker group default. PostgreSQL makes
rotation, capacity, pause, and manual deadlines database-authoritative across
brokers.

### 6.5 DLQ

`Dlq` (`queue`, `count?` → `{jobs}` top-level), `RetryDlq` (`queue`,
`jobId?`, `count?` → `{count}`), `PurgeDlq` (→ `{count}`),
`RemoveDlqJob` (`queue`, `jobId` → `{data:{removed:boolean}}`),
`RetryCompleted`.
"Retry a failed job" is `MoveToWait`; `RetryDlq` re-queues dead-lettered
entries.

### 6.6 Schedulers (cron)

| `CronList`   | —                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | `{crons: []}`                                  |
| `CronDelete` | `name`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | `{}`                                           |

- An SDK "limit" option MUST map to wire **`maxLimit`** (#111). `maxLimit`
  `<= 0` means unlimited.
- `repeatEvery`, when supplied, MUST be a positive safe integer in milliseconds and is
  rejected before mutation otherwise. At least one timing field is required;
  for compatibility, `schedule` wins when both valid fields are present.
- `name` identifies the globally registered schedule. `jobName` is the
  first-class name assigned to jobs spawned by that schedule; legacy peers may
  omit it and use the bounded legacy payload-envelope fallback.
- `jobOptions` accepts only the `CronJobOptions` subset (`maxAttempts`,
  `backoff`, `timeout`, `delay`, `stallTimeout`, `removeOnComplete`,
  `removeOnFail`) — anything else there is silently ignored by the server,
  so clients MUST map their names into it.
- A scheduler that reaches `maxLimit` is **removed** from the scheduler map:
  a subsequent `CronGet`/`CronDelete` answers "not found". Cleanup code must
  tolerate that.

### 6.7 Webhooks, rate limits, monitoring

- `AddWebhook` (`url`, `events`) → **`{data: {webhookId}}`**. Localhost and
  private-network URLs are rejected (SSRF guard). Event names look like
  `job.completed`.
- `RemoveWebhook` takes **`webhookId`**; `SetWebhookEnabled` takes **`id`**.
  Yes, they differ; both are normative.
- `ListWebhooks` → `{data: {webhooks}}`.
- `RateLimit` takes `queue`, **`limit`**, and two optional fields (both since
  server 2.8.35): **`duration`** (window in ms the limit applies to, default
  1000 = `limit` per second) and **`ttl`** (auto-expiry in ms: the broker
  clears the limit itself after this long, lazily on the next pull or limit
  read). Non-finite or non-positive values degrade to the defaults (1s
  window, permanent) instead of failing the command. Older servers ignore
  both fields. `RateLimitClear` clears the limit.
  `SetConcurrency`/`ClearConcurrency` use `limit`.
- `ListWorkers` → `{data: {workers}}`; `Stats` → `{stats}`; legacy broker-wide
  `Metrics` → `{metrics}`. Queue-scoped
  `Metrics(queue,type,start,end)` → `{data:{meta,data,count}}`, and
  `TrimEvents(queue,maxLength)` → `{data:{removed}}`. `ListQueues` → `{queues}`
  (names as strings); `Ping` →
  `{data: {pong}}`.
- `StorageStatus` → `{data:{diskFull,error,since}}`. A SQLite disk-full status
  keeps its actionable error string. Other storage failures set `diskFull:false`
  and expose only `Internal server error`; SQLSTATE, constraint, host, driver,
  and connection diagnostics are never part of a protocol response. The same
  projection applies to health/readiness and dashboard payloads.

### 6.8 Response wrapping summary

Wrapped in `data`: `GetLogs → data.logs`, `ListWorkers → data.workers`,
`GetChildrenValues → data.values`, `AddWebhook → data.webhookId`,
`ListWebhooks → data.webhooks`, `Ping`/`Heartbeat → data.pong`,
`RegisterWorker → data`, and every job-group getter/control result listed in
section 6.4.

Top-level: `IsPaused → paused`, `CronGet → cron`, `CronList → crons`,
`GetProgress → progress/message`, `PULL → job+token`, `PULLB → jobs+tokens`,
`PUSH → id`, `PUSHB → ids`, `Count`/`Clean`/`Drain`/`RetryDlq` → `count`,
`Dlq → jobs`, `Stats → stats`, `GetJobCounts → counts`,
`GetFailedChildrenValues`/`GetIgnoredChildrenFailures → values`.

There is no general rule — the wrapping above is historical and normative.

## 7. Flows (parent/child trees)

Current official clients create flows with one `PUSHF` request. They allocate
all IDs and validate the complete tree/chain/fan-in plan before transport, then
send:

```text
{ cmd: "PUSHF", jobs: [{ id, queue, input }, ...] }
```

Every `input` carries a top-level `name`, untouched user `data`, the ordinary
`PUSH` options, and fully resolved `parentId`, `childrenIds`, and `dependsOn`. The
broker revalidates unique IDs, limits, acyclicity, existing ownership, and
reciprocal edges before mutation. It returns
`{data: {jobs: Job[]}}` with one authoritative snapshot per input. With SQLite,
one immediate transaction commits all rows before in-memory publication. With
PostgreSQL, one database transaction admits the complete graph and publishes
its outbox events atomically. Without storage, visibility is still atomic but
intentionally not crash-durable.

Previously published clients may use the legacy children-first sequence:
`PUSH` children with a `pending` marker, `PUSH` a parent that already declares
their IDs, then `UpdateParent`. For a predeclared edge, `UpdateParent` only
back-patches the child and never reschedules an active or terminal parent.
SQLite updates the job/DLQ child snapshot and re-keys any failure outbox record
atomically. Adding a new edge is restricted to a queued parent. The legacy
multi-request sequence remains compatible but cannot provide `PUSHF`
all-or-nothing visibility.

## 8. TLS

With `TLS_CERT_FILE`/`TLS_KEY_FILE` the server speaks native TLS on the same
port. Clients MUST verify the server certificate by default (issue #109
class) and MAY offer CA-file pinning and an explicit opt-out. A client MUST
NOT silently accept unverified peers.

## 9. Timeouts, reconnection, half-open links

- Clients SHOULD apply a per-command timeout (reference default 30 s;
  long-poll commands get the poll timeout plus headroom).
- A command timeout means the stream state is unknown: the client MUST tear
  the socket down rather than keep reading (half-open guard, issue #94
  class) and reconnect lazily on the next call, re-running `Auth` (and
  `RegisterWorker` for workers).
- The server enforces: `PULLB.timeout <= 60000`, `WaitJob.timeout <=
600000`, `PULLB.count <= 1000`. Clients MUST clamp rather than surface
  avoidable validation errors for values their API accepts.

## 10. Server limits and defaults (informative)

## 11. Conformance

The machine-checkable version of this document is the conformance suite in
[`sdk/conformance/`](../sdk/conformance/). A client is **conformant** when
its driver passes every check against a real server. The suite is the
gatekeeper for calling a client "official": reference SDKs (TypeScript,
Python, PHP, Go, Rust, Elixir) are kept green in CI-style runs before every
release.

## 12. Versioning

- The protocol version is a single integer advertised by `Hello`
  (currently **3**). Additive changes (new commands, new optional fields)
  do not bump it; breaking changes to framing, envelope, or existing field
  semantics do.
- This document is versioned with the repository; changes to the wire MUST
  update it in the same change-set (see `CLAUDE.md` docs rule).
