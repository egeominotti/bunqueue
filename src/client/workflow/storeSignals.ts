/**
 * SignalCoordinator — sole owner of the `signals` column.
 *
 * Signal payloads cannot be persisted the way step state is. A worker holds one
 * in-memory `Execution` for the whole duration of a node, so any full-row write from
 * that snapshot silently reverts a signal that landed while the node was running —
 * the approval disappears and the run parks forever
 * (test/repro-workflow-signal-lost-update.test.ts).
 *
 * So every mutation of `signals` goes through here instead: read-modify-write inside
 * a transaction, and the two state transitions that pair with it ('waiting' ->
 * 'running' on resume, 'running' -> 'waiting' on park) expressed as conditional
 * UPDATEs. Making those conditional is also what collapses duplicate or concurrent
 * signals to exactly one resume, at the database rather than relying on the event
 * loop never yielding at the right moment.
 *
 * The third transition that pairs with a signal, a timed-out gate failing because its
 * signal is still absent, lives in storeWaitExpiry.ts. It reads this column inside the
 * same kind of IMMEDIATE reservation and never writes it, so a late signal and the
 * timeout are decided first-writer-wins exactly like two concurrent signals.

/**
 * Has this signal arrived? A KEY test, deliberately not a value test.
 *
 * `payload` is optional on `Engine.signal()`, so "the human said go" with nothing to
 * carry is recorded as `signals[event] = undefined`. The codec is configured with
 * `structuredClone: true` and round-trips that faithfully — the key is present, the
 * value is `undefined` — so `signals[event] !== undefined` answers "did it arrive?"
 * with NO for the most idiomatic call in the whole human-in-the-loop API.
 *
 * That disagreed with `record()`, which claims the resume without inspecting the
 * payload: the run resumed, re-entered the waitFor, was told no signal had arrived,
 * and parked again. With a timeout it then expired and compensated work the approver
 * had just authorised (`test/repro-workflow-signal-no-payload.test.ts`).
 *
 * The predicate itself is `Object.hasOwn`, and an earlier revision of this comment
 * claimed `in` was safe here because the object is always a fresh decode. That was
 * wrong twice over: `in` walks the prototype chain regardless of where the object came
 * from, and the EVENT NAME is user-supplied even when the object is not.

  // anything. The value test that preceded it failed identically, because
  // `signals['toString']` is the inherited function and not `undefined`.
  //
  // The names are not exotic in a real vocabulary, and an event name read from config
